abstract = {A linear programming model has been developed for optimal cash flow management addressing specific cash flow issues related to the construction in industry. These include financial transactions, possible delays on payments, use of available credit lines, effect of changing interest rates, and budget constraints that often occur in the construction industry. A small size project from the Brazilian construction industry is provided as a case study, aiming at evaluating the potential benefits from using the model. Different changes to the basic structure of the model allow and establish the consistency of the results. Alternative formulations are suggested to deal with uncertainties, longer planning horizons, and multiple subcontractors and suppliers. In addition to the tangible financial earnings derived from the optimization process, the simple structure of the model, as a network flow and corresponding equations, provides much visual insight concerning the relationships between the external inputs and the variables of the problem. Optimal results have yet to be achieved in a real life situation, but a better view of whole cash flow management is provided when using the model.},

abstract = {Reference interaction site model (RISM) has recently become a popular approach in the study of thermodynamical and structural properties of the solvent around macromolecules. On the other hand, it was widely suggested that there exists water density depletion around large hydrophobic solutes ({\textgreater}1 nm), and this may pose a great challenge to the RISM theory. In this paper, we develop a new analytical theory, the Reference Interaction Site Model with Hydrophobicity induced density Inhomogeneity (RISM-HI), to compute solvent radial distribution function (RDF) around large hydrophobic solute in water as well as its mixture with other polyatomic organic solvents. To achieve this, we have explicitly considered the density inhomogeneity at the solute-solvent interface using the framework of the Yvon-Born-Green hierarchy, and the RISM theory is used to obtain the solute-solvent pair correlation. In order to efficiently solve the relevant equations while maintaining reasonable accuracy, we have also developed a new closure called the D2 closure. With this new theory, the solvent RDFs around a large hydrophobic particle in water and different water-acetonitrile mixtures could be computed, which agree well with the results of the molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we show that our RISM-HI theory can also efficiently compute the solvation free energy of solute with a wide range of hydrophobicity in various water-acetonitrile solvent mixtures with a reasonable accuracy. We anticipate that our theory could be widely applied to compute the thermodynamic and structural properties for the solvation of hydrophobic solute. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Abstract The integration equation theory (IET) provides highly efficient tools for the calculation of structural and thermodynamic properties of molecular liquids. In recent years, the 3D reference interaction site model (3DRISM), the most developed IET for solvation, has been widely applied to study protein solvation, aggregation, and drug-receptor binding. However, hydrophobic solutes with sufficient size ({\textgreater}nm) can induce water density depletion at the solute–solvent interface. This density depletion is not considered in the original 3DRISM theory. The authors here review the recent developments of 3DRISM at hydrophobic surfaces and related theories to address this challenge. At hydrophobic surfaces, an additional hydrophobicity-induced density inhomogeneity equation is introduced to 3DRISM theory to consider this density depletion. Accordingly, several new closures equations including D2 closure and D2MSA closures are developed to enable stable numerical solutions of 3DRISM equations. These newly developed theories hold great promise for an accurate and rapid calculation of the solvation effect for complex molecular systems such as proteins. At the end of the report, the authors also provide a perspective on other challenges of the IETs as an efficient solvation model.},

   abstract = {We developed a technique to decrease memory requirements when solving the integral equations of three-dimensional (3D) molecular theory of solvation, a.k.a. 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM), using the modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace (MDIIS) numerical method of generalized minimal residual type. The latter provides robust convergence, in particular, for charged systems and electrolyte solutions with strong associative effects for which damped iterations do not converge. The MDIIS solver (typically, with 2 X 10 iterative vectors of argument and residual for fast convergence) treats the solute excluded volume (core), while handling the solvation shells in the 3D box with two vectors coupled with MDIIS iteratively and incorporating the electrostatic asymptotics outside the box analytically. For solvated systems from small to large macromolecules and solidliquid interfaces, this results in 6- to 16-fold memory reduction and corresponding CPU load decrease in MDIIS. We illustrated the new technique on solvated systems of chemical and biomolecular relevance with different dimensionality, both in ambient water and aqueous electrolyte solution, by solving the 3D-RISM equations with the KovalenkoHirata (KH) closure, and the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure where convergent. This coreshell-asymptotics technique coupling MDIIS for the excluded volume core with iteration of the solvation shells converges as efficiently as MDIIS for the whole 3D box and yields the solvation structure and thermodynamics without loss of accuracy. Although being of benefit for solutes of any size, this memory reduction becomes critical in 3D-RISM calculations for large solvated systems, such as macromolecules in solution with ions, ligands, and other cofactors.

The PMF is calculated as a difference in the solvation free energy of an ion pair and of individual ions. We obtained and analyzed in detail the PMFs and solvation structure for ion pairs of NaCl at infinite dilution and a concentration of 1 M. The results are in reasonably good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations for the same model of the solution species. Positions and orientations of water molecules in the first solvation shell around the ion pair are deduced. The short-range hydration structure of the ion pairs at infinite dilution and at moderate concentration is very similar. Ionic ordering and clustering is found in 1 M solution.},

Unlike the PBSA or GBSA semiempirical approaches, the 3D-RISM-KH theory yields a full molecular picture of the solvation structure and thermodynamics from the first principles, with proper account of chemical specificities of both solvent and biomolecules, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges, etc. We test the method on the binding of seven biotin analogues to avidin in aqueous solution and show it to work well in predicting the ligand-binding affinities. We have compared the results of 3D- RISM-KH with four different generalized Born and two Poisson-Boltzmann methods. They give absolute binding energies that differ by up to 208 kJ/mol and mean absolute deviations in the relative affinities of 10-43 kJ/mol.},

abstract = {Solvation forces dominate protein structure and dynamics. Integral equation theories allow a rapid and accurate evaluation of the effect of solvent around a complex solute, without the sampling issues associated with simulations of explicit solvent molecules. Advances in integral equation theories make it possible to calculate the angle dependent average solvent structure around an irregular molecular solution. We consider two methodological problems here: the treatment of long-ranged forces without the use of artificial periodicity or truncations and the effect of closures. We derive a method for calculating the long-ranged Coulomb interaction contributions to three-dimensional distribution functions involving only a rewriting of the system of integral equations and introducing no new formal approximations. We show the comparison of the exact forms with those implied by the supercell method. The supercell method is shown to be a good approximation for neutral solutes whereas the new method does not exhibit the known problems of the supercell method for charged solutes. Our method appears more numerically stable with respect to thermodynamic starting state. We also compare closures including the Kovalenko-Hirata closure, the hypernetted-chain (HNC) and an approximate three-dimensional bridge function combined with the HNC closure. Comparisons to molecular dynamics results are made for water as well as for the protein solute bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The proposed equations have less severe approximations and often provide results which compare favorably to molecular dynamics simulation where other methods fail.},

abstract = {A molecular-level description of the behavior of water in hydrophobic spaces is presented in terms of the coupled effects of solute size and atomic solute-solvent interactions. For model solutes with surface areas near those of protein contacts, we identify three different regions of solute-water interaction to be associated with three distinctly different structural characteristics of water in the intersolute region: dry, oscillating, and wet. A first orderlike phase transition is confirmed from the wet to dry state bridged by a narrow region with liquid-vapor oscillations in the intersolute region as the strength of the solute-water attractive dispersion interaction decreases. We demonstrate that the recent idea that cavitation in the intersolute region of nanoscopic solutes is preceded by the formation of a vapor layer around an individual solute is not the general case. The appearance of density waves pulled up around and outside of a nanoscopic plate occurs at lower interaction strengths than are required to obtain a wet state between such plates. We further show that chemically reasonable estimates of the interaction strength lead to a microscopically wet state and a hydrophobic interaction characterized by traps and barriers to association and not by vacuum induced collapse.},

More than 30 drug candidates derived from fragments have entered the clinic, with two approved and several more in advanced trials. FBDD has been widely applied in both academia and industry, as evidenced by the large number of papers from universities, non-profit research institutions, biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, FBDD draws on a diverse range of disciplines, from biochemistry and biophysics to computational and medicinal chemistry. As the promise of FBDD strategies becomes increasingly realized, now is an opportune time to draw lessons and point the way to the future.

abstract = {Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is a technique for identifying low molecular weight chemical starting points for drug discovery. Since its inception 20 years ago, FBDD has grown in popularity to the point where it is now an established technique in industry and academia. The approach involves the biophysical screening of proteins against collections of low molecular weight compounds (fragments). Although fragments bind to proteins with relatively low affinity, they form efficient, high quality binding interactions with the protein architecture as they have to overcome a significant entropy barrier to bind. Of the biophysical methods available for fragment screening, X-ray protein crystallography is one of the most sensitive and least prone to false positives. It also provides detailed structural information of the protein–fragment complex at the atomic level. Fragment-based screening using X-ray crystallography is therefore an efficient method for identifying binding hotspots on proteins, which can then be exploited by chemists and biologists for the discovery of new drugs. The use of FBDD is illustrated here with a recently published case study of a drug discovery programme targeting the challenging protein–protein interaction Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1:nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic hydration plays a crucial role in self-assembly processes over multiple length scales, from the microscopic origins of inert gas solubility in water, to the mesoscopic organization of proteins and surfactant structures, to macroscopic phase separation. Many theoretical studies focus on the molecularly detailed interactions between oil and water, but the extrapolation of molecular-scale models to larger-length-scale hydration phenomena is sometimes not warranted. Scaled particle theories are based upon an interpolative view of that microscopic {\textless}-{\textgreater} macroscopic issue. This Colloquium revisits the scaled particle theory proposed 30 years ago by Stillinger [J. Solution Chem. 2, 141 (1973)], adopts a practical generalization, and considers the implications for hydrophobic hydration in light of our current understanding. The generalization is based upon identifying a molecular length, implicit in previous applications of scaled particle models, which provides an effective radius for joining microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. It will be demonstrated that the generalized theory correctly reproduces many of the anomalous thermodynamic properties of hydrophobic hydration for molecularly sized solutes, including solubility minima and entropy convergence, successfully interpolates between the microscopic and macroscopic extremes, and provides new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. The model considered here serves as a reference for theories that bridge microscopic and macroscopic hydrophobic effects. The results are discussed in terms of length scales associated with component phenomena. In particular, first there is a discussion of the microscopic-macroscopic joining radius identified by the theory; then follows a discussion of the Tolman length that describes curvature corrections to a surface area model of hydrophobic hydration free energies and the length scales on which entropy convergence of hydration free energies are expected.},

abstract = {Historical interpretations of the thermodynamics characterizing biomolecular recognition have marginalized the role of water. An important (even, perhaps, dominant) contribution to molecular recognition in water comes from the "hydrophobic effect," in which non-polar portions of a ligand interact preferentially with non-polar regions of a protein. Water surrounds the ligand, and water fills the binding pocket of the protein: when the protein-ligand complex forms, and hydrophobic surfaces of the binding pocket and the ligand approach one another, the molecules (and hydrogen-bonded networks of molecules) of water associated with both surfaces rearrange and, in part, entirely escape into the bulk solution. It is now clear that neither of the two most commonly cited rationalizations for the hydrophobic effect-an entropy-dominated hydrophobic effect, in which ordered waters at the surface of the ligand, and water at the surface of the protein, are released to the bulk upon binding, and a "lock-and-key" model, in which the surface of a ligand interacts directly with a surface of a protein having a complementary shape-can account for water-mediated interactions between the ligand and the protein, and neither is sufficient to account for the experimental observation of both entropy- andenthalpy-dominated hydrophobic effects. What is now clear is that there is no single hydrophobic effect, with a universally applicable, common, thermodynamic description: different processes (i.e., partitioning between phases of different hydrophobicity, aggregation in water, and binding) with different thermodynamics, depend on the molecular-level details of the structures of the molecules involved, and of the aggregates that form. A "water-centric" description of the hydrophobic effect in biomolecular recognition focuses on the structures of water surrounding the ligand, and of water filling the binding pocket of the protein, both before and after binding. This view attributes the hydrophobic effect to changes in the free energy of the networks of hydrogen bonds that are formed, broken, or re-arranged when two hydrophobic surfaces approach (but do not necessarily contact) one another. The details of the molecular topography (and the polar character) of the mole- cular surfaces play an important role in determining the structure of these networks of hydrogen-bonded waters, and in the thermodynamic description of the hydrophobic effect(s). Theorists have led the formulation of this "water-centric view", although experiments are now supplying support for it. It poses complex problems for would-be "designers" of protein-ligand interactions, and for so-called "rational drug design".},

In the interdomain region, liquid water persists with a density 10 to 15{\{}{\%}{\}} lower than in the bulk, even at small domain separations. Water depletion and hydrophobic collapse occur on a nanosecond time scale, which is two orders of magnitude slower than that found in the collapse of idealized paraffin-like plates. When the electrostatic protein-water forces are turned off, a dewetting transition occurs in the interdomain region and the collapse speeds up by more than an order of magnitude. When attractive van der Waals forces are turned off as well, the dewetting in the interdomain region is more profound, and the collapse is even faster.},

abstract = {We modify the site-site as well as three-dimensional (3D) versions of the reference interaction site model (RISM) integral equations with the hypernetted chain (HNC) closures by adding a repulsive bridge correction (RBC). The RBC treats the overestimation of water ordering around a hydrophobic solute in the RISM/HNC approximation, and thus refines the entropic component in the hydration free energy. We build up the bridge functions on r(-12) repulsive core potentials, and propose RBC expressions for both the site-site and 3D-RISM approaches. To provide fast calculation, we obtain the excess chemical potential of hydration by using the thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT). The site-site RISM/HNC+RBC as well as 3D-RISM/HNC+RBC approaches are applied to calculate the structure and thermodynamics of hydration of rare gases and alkanes in ambient water. For both approaches, the RBC drastically improves the agreement of the hydration chemical potential with simulation data and provides its correct dependence on the solute size. For solutes of a nonspherical form, the 3D treatment yields the hydration structure in detail and better fits simulation results, whereas the site-site approach is essentially faster. The TPT approximation gives the hydration thermodynamics in good qualitative agreement with the exact results of the thermodynamic integration, and substantially reduces computational burden. The RBC-TPT approximation can improve the predictive capability of the hybrid algorithm of a generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo simulation combined with the site-site RISM theory, used to describe protein folding with due account for the water effect at the microscopic level. The RBC can be optimized for better fit to reference simulation data, and can be generalized for solute molecules with charged groups. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

The functional is not pair decomposable and the resulting polymer problem is not trivial to solve. The evaluation of the electron partition function and correlation functions is pursued with two approximations: (i) a mean field approximation which neglects the role of polymer fluctuations on the solvent induced interactions: (ii) a polaron approximation which is a linear approximation in the sense that it neglects large fluctuations in the polymer structure itself.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanics energies combined with the Poisson-Boltzmann or generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation (MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA) methods are popular approaches to estimate the free energy of the binding of small ligands to biological macromolecules. They are typically based on molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor-ligand complex and are therefore intermediate in both accuracy and computational effort between empirical scoring and strict alchemical perturbation methods. They have been applied to a large number of systems with varying success. Areas covered: The authors review the use of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to calculate ligand-binding affinities, with an emphasis on calibration, testing and validation, as well as attempts to improve the methods, rather than on specific applications. Expert opinion: MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are attractive approaches owing to their modular nature and that they do not require calculations on a training set. They have been used successfully to reproduce and rationalize experimental findings and to improve the results of virtual screening and docking. However, they contain several crude and questionable approximations, for example, the lack of conformational entropy and information about the number and free energy of water molecules in the binding site. Moreover, there are many variants of the method and their performance varies strongly with the tested system. Likewise, most attempts to ameliorate the methods with more accurate approaches, for example, quantum-mechanical calculations, polarizable force fields or improved solvation have deteriorated the results.},

abstract = {Pure water experimental and simulation results are combined to predict the thermodynamics of cavity formation, spanning atomic to macroscopic length scales, over the entire ambient liquid temperature range. The resulting cavity equation of state is used to quantify dewetting excess contributions to cavity formation thermodynamics and construct a thermodynamic perturbation theory of hydrophobic hydration. Predictions are compared with large cavity simulations and experimental rare-gas hydration thermodynamics data (for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn). Key findings include the strong temperature dependence of the critical length scale for hydrophobic dewetting and the evaluation of fundamental solute-solvent interaction contributions to rare-gas hydration chemical potentials.},

abstract = {All molecules can be viewed as either discrete or continuous assemblies of electric charges, and electrostatics plays a major role in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Moreover, charge distribution within molecules may fluctuate due to the presence of ionizable groups capable of exchanging protons with the environment, leading to pH-dependence of phenomena involving such molecules. Electrostatic aspects of complex shapes and environments of biological molecules, in vitro and in vivo, are relatively well amenable to treatment by Poisson-Boltzmann models, which are attractive in that they possess a clear physical meaning, and can be readily solved by several mathematically sound methods. Here we describe applications of these models to obtain valuable insights into some biologically important pH-dependent properties of biomolecules, such as stability, binding of ligands (including potential drugs), enzymatic activity, conformational transitions, membrane transport and viral entry.},

The theoretical basis of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is reviewed and a wide range of applications is presented, including the computation of the electrostatic potential at the solvent-accessible molecular surface, the computation of encounter rates between molecules in solution, the computation of the free energy of association and its salt dependence, the study of pKa shifts and the combination with classical molecular mechanics and dynamics. Theoretical results may be used for rationalizing or predicting experimental results, or for suggesting working hypotheses.

abstract = {The search for new drugs is plagued by high attrition rates at all stages in research and development. Chemists have an opportunity to tackle this problem because attrition can be traced back, in part, to the quality of the chemical leads. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is a new approach, increasingly used in the pharmaceutical industry, for reducing attrition and providing leads for previously intractable biological targets. FBDD identifies low-molecular-weight ligands (∼150 Da) that bind to biologically important macromolecules. The three-dimensional experimental binding mode of these fragments is determined using X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, and is used to facilitate their optimization into potent molecules with drug-like properties. Compared with high-throughput-screening, the fragment approach requires fewer compounds to be screened, and, despite the lower initial potency of the screening hits, offers more efficient and fruitful optimization campaigns. Here, we review the rise of FBDD, including its application to discovering clinical candidates against targets for which other chemistry approaches have struggled.},

A simple macroscopic thermodynamic model based on Young's law successfully predicts drying between the stacked plates and accounts for the free-energy barriers to this drying. However, because drying around a single plate is not macroscopic, a molecular theory is required to describe it. The data are consistent with the rate-determining step in the hydrophobic collapse of the two plates being a large-scale drying fluctuation, characterized by a free-energy barrier that grows with particle size.},

abstract = {Here, direct noninvasive neutron reflectivity measurements reveal the presence of a reduced (deuterated) water density region, with a sigmoidal density profile at the hydrophobic silane–water interface that depends on the type and concentration of dissolved gases in the water. Removal of dissolved gases decreases the width of the reduced water density region, and their reintroduction leads to its increase. When compared with recent computer simulations, a locally fluctuating density profile is proposed, whereas preexisting nanobubbles are excluded. The presence of a fluctuating reduced water density region between two hydrophobic surfaces and the attractive “depletion force” to which it leads may help explain the hydrophobic force and its reported diminution in deaerated water. Our results are also quantitatively consistent with recent dynamic surface force apparatus results that drastically revise previous estimates of the slip length of water flowing past hydrophobic surfaces from microns to ≈20 nm. Our observations, therefore, go a long way toward reconciling three quite different types of experiments and phenomena: water depletion at hydrophobic surfaces, water slip at hydrophobic surfaces, and the hydrophobic interaction.},

Multiple MD simulations have been carried out to study the diffusive behaviour of O(2) and CO(2) molecules from the Mg(2+) cation in Rubisco at 298 K and 1 bar, being one step in the overall process of carboxylation/oxygenation in Rubisco. In addition to this work, in order to gain additional perspective on the role of chemical reaction rates and thermodynamics, oxygen, and carbon dioxide uptake mechanisms have also been investigated by the aid of quantum chemical calculations. The results indicate that the activation barrier for carboxylation is slightly lower than that of oxygenation. This agrees qualitatively with experimental findings, and rationalises the observed competition between both catalytic processes in nature. Finally, the longer-lived persistence of CO(2) in the vicinity of the active centre (i.e., slower self-diffusion) may serve to explain, in part, why carboxylation is the more kinetically favoured on an overall basis compared to oxygenation.},

abstract = {The three-deimensional distribution functions (3D-DFs) and potentials of mean force (PMFs) of small neutral molecules inside the two aquaporin channels, AQP1 and GlpF, are calculated based on the 3D-RISM theory, the statistical mechanics theory of molecular liquids, in order to investigate the permeability of those ligands through the channels. The ligands investigated are neon (Ne), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH(3)), urea, and glycerol. Neon shows continuous distribution throughout the channel pore in AQP1 as is the case of water, although the PMF of Ne at the selective filter (SF) region is higher than that of water, indicating that the stability of molecules in the channel is determined not only by their size, but also by the charge distribution. The ligand molecules, CO(2), NO, urea, and glycerol, have a large barrier in PMF at the SF region in AQP1, indicating that the channel is not permeable by those ligands. On the other hand, NH(3) has only a small activation barrier, approximately 2.5 kJ/mol, to be overcome. Therefore, our theory predicts that a NH(3) molecule can be permeated through the AQP1 channel. In GlpF, all the ligands have negative PMF throughout the channel pore except for glycerol, which has a small barrier at the SF area, approximately 2.1 kJ/mol. The barrier can be readily overcome by the thermal motion. So, our results are quite consistent with the experiments for urea and glycerol, for which the corresponding data are available. The results obtained by the 3D-RISM theory show striking differences from those obtained by the MD simulations, especially in the case of GlpF. Possible causes of the difference in the results between the two methods are discussed.},

The hydration structures of the trans and the gauche conformers of n-butane are presented and analyzed at the atomic level in terms of the atomic solute-solvent radial distribution functions. With these radial distribution functions as input, the n-butane conformational average hydration free energies, energies, enthalpies, and entropies are calculated. At room temperature, the normalized equilibrium distribution of n-butane conformers, the water solvent-induced rotational free energy surface and the trans-gauche and trans-cis cavity thermodynamic properties are calculated. With the optimized nonbonded potential parameters based on the CHARMM96 all-atom model for alkanes (Yin, D.; Mackerell, A. D., Jr. J. Comput. Chem. 1998, 19, 3 34), n-butane hydration thermodynamics and its conformational equilibria in water are well described by the HNC-RISM theory in comparison with the available experimental and computer simulation results. We also calculated the solute density derivatives of the water-water radial distribution functions deltah(vv), with the optimized CHARMM96 all-atom model, the united-atom OPLS (optimized potentials for liquid simulations), and the all-atom OPLS models for n-butane, respectively. The deltah(vv)(r) reflect the effect of increased pressure disrupting the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. The all-atom model seems to enhance such an effect due to the well-documented shortcoming of the RISM theory in the treatment of the excluded volume of so-called auxiliary sites.},

The method yields all of the features available by using other solvation approaches, for instance infrared spectra of solvated molecules. To evaluate the accuracy of the present method, test calculations have been carried out for a number of small molecules, including four glycine conformers, a set of small organic compounds, and carbon nanotubes of various lengths in aqueous solution.

The RBC contribution to the excess chemical potential of solvation is calculated by means of the thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT), which crucially reduces computational burden and thus is especially important for a hybrid algorithm of the RISM with molecular simulation. The 3D-RISM/HNC+RBC-TPT approach provides improved prediction of the solvation thermodynamics and gives a detailed description of the solvation structure of a biomolecule. The results obtained are discussed and compared to those following from the 1D-RISM/HNC theory. The latter yields physically reasonable results for the conformational stability of biomolecules in solution, which is further improved by adding the 1D-RBC. The modified, 1D-RISM/HNC+RBC-TPT integral equation theory combined with the simulated annealing or generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo simulation methods is capable of reliable prediction of conformations of biomolecules in solution with due account for the solvent effect at the microscopic level.

abstract = {The dynamic properties of both the solute and solvent of the aqueous solution of benzene, xenon and neon are calculated by the mode-coupling theory for molecular liquids based on the interaction-site model. The B-coefficients of the reorientational relaxation and the translational diffusion of the solvent are evaluated from their dependence on the concentration of the solute, and the reorientational relaxation time of water within the hydration shell is estimated based on the two-state model. The reorientational relaxation times of water in the bulk and within the hydration shell, that of solute, and the translational diffusion coefficients of solute and solvent, are calculated at 0-30 degrees C. The temperature dependence of these dynamic properties is in qualitative agreement with that of NMR experiment reported by Nakahara et al. (M. Nakahara, C. Wakai, Y. Yoshimoto and N. Matubayasi, J. Phys. Chem., 1996, 100, 1345-1349, ref. 36), although the agreement of the absolute values is not so good. The B-coefficients of the reorientational relaxation times for benzene, xenon and neon solution are correlated with the hydration number and the partial molar volume of the solute. The proportionality with the latter is better than that with the former. These results support the mechanism that the retardation of the mobility of water is caused by the cavity formation of the solute, as previously suggested by us (T. Yamaguchi, T. Matsuoka and S. Koda, J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 120, 7590-7601, ref. 34), rather than the conventional one that the rigid hydration structure formed around the hydrophobic solute reduces the mobility of water.},

It is then found that the Percus–Yevick, hypernetted-chain, and superposition approximations in the energetic representation determine the solvent distribution functions correctly to first-order with respect to the solute–solvent interaction potential and to the solvent density.

A full atom model of the host in its D-3h conformation is used for the calculations. The difference of binding free energies between the various ions is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data in the case of methanol, less accurate for acetonitrile. Additional information about the structure of the FES is extracted by scanning its topography. Two-dimensional slices through the FES are presented to illustrate the solvation structure of the complexes.

abstract = {We report three new closures to the reference interaction site method (RISM) integral equation. The formulation of the closures is motivated by an analogy with an alternative form of the Ornstein -Zernike hypernetted-chain closure for a simple ionic mixture. Unlike other RISM integral equation closures proposed to date, the closures reported here predict nontrivial results for the dielectric constant epsilon (0) of model polar fluids. Interestingly, we find that, for models of polar fluids comprising molecules with only two nonequivalent interaction sites (such as dipolar dumbbells or the popular three-site representations of water), all of the new closures give simple analytical formulas for epsilon (0). These simple analytical results indicate that only one of the closures is based on a relation that can account for the dependence of epsilon (0) upon the thermodynamic state parameters of the liquid and the features of the molecular model (size and shape) separately, rather than in the ubiquitous dipolar strength parameter combination 4 pip mu (2)/3k(B)T. for this promising closure we solve numerically the RISM integral equation and calculate the site-site correlation functions g(jl)(r) and the dielectric properties for dipolar dumbbell liquids, for the SPC/E model of water, and for a four-site interaction site model of dimethyl sulfoxide.},

abstract = {IGF-I increases abundance of IGFBP-5 mRNA in rat intestinal smooth muscle cells (RISM), and IGFBP-5 protein in RISM conditioned media. The translational blocker, cycloheximide, decreased the abundance of IGFBP-5 mRNA to undetectable levels, suggesting that IGFBP-5 mRNA integrity is linked to protein synthesis. We studied the mechanism of IGF-I's effect on IGFBP-5 mRNA, and the role of cytoplasmic proteins in modulating IGFBP-5 mRNA abundance. Anisomycin, emetine, and puromycin abolished IGFBP-5 mRNA as seen with cycloheximide. Cycloheximide had a dose- and time-dependent effect on IGFBP-5 mRNA. IGF-I increased IGFBP-5 nuclear transcripts by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), suggesting that IGF-I acts at least partially by increasing IGFBP-5 mRNA transcription. Protein synthesis inhibitors did not affect IGFBP-5 nuclear transcripts, therefore, they affect only mature mRNA. The IGFBP-5 mRNA 3' and 5' UTRs were cloned and their sequences searched for adenosine-uridine rich elements (AUREs), elements shown to regulate RNA stability. RNA mobility gel shift assay showed two protein activities that bind to nt 922 to 2076 of the 3' UTR, a region that contains an AURE. One protein activity (BA2) was decreased in cytoplasmic extracts from cyclohexirnide-treated RISM. These data demonstrate that IGFBP-5 mRNA integrity is dependent on protein synthesis. The 3' UTR of IGFBP-5 contains elements shown to bind proteins important for RNA stability regulation. This region binds RISM cytoplasmic proteins, and may mediate the dramatic effect of cycloheximide on IGFBP-5 abundance. RNA-protein interactions may be important to IGFBP-5 mRNA stability and ultimately, to IGFBP-5 actions. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The electron and classical subsystems are coupled in the mean field approximation. The classical potentials of the metal acting on species of the liquid are taken in the linear response regime. Many-body effects of dense liquid on metal valence electrons are allowed for by averaging pseudopotentials of liquid molecules over the site distributions of liquid. The coupled KS DFT and 3D RISM equations are solved simultaneously by using the procedure of dynamic relaxation. The proposed approach is substantially less time-consuming as compared to a Car-Parrinello type simulation. A partial linearization of the hypernetted chain (PLHNC) closure to the RISM equation is proposed. The calculation is performed in the supercell technique for water at normal conditions in contact with the (100) FCC slab of a metal roughly modeled after copper. The results are in good agreement with the Car-Parrinello simulation for the same model. Further applications of the method proposed are discussed.},

Central cracks occur when superplastic sheets are formed with injection molding with higher melt temperature, while edge cracks occur with higher injection pressure. When the melt flow is parallel to the sheet rolling direction, the areas of edge crack are enlarged. The sheet thickness ratio distribution is obtained for various injection parameters and rib depths.

abstract = {Using the mutually consistent variant of the integral equation polymer reference interaction site model (RISM) theory and the chemically realistic rotational isomeric state (RIS) model, we perform a molecular level modeling of the specific structural organization of perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer (Nafion) with certain amount of physisorbed water. Our results establish molecular scale information necessary for understanding the equilibrium structure and thermodynamics of water-containing Nafion as well as water distribution and ionic (molecular) transport phenomena in hydrated Nafion membranes. As a first step in this direction, semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations on the molecular structures and energies of the polymeric backbone and pendant chains of Nafion with and without additional water molecules are carried out. These data are used in the single-polymer RIS Monte Carlo simulation, in which the short-range intramolecular interactions are taken into account via appropriate matrices of statistical weights. The local structure and morphology of the entire bicomponent water-containing system is calculated consistently on the basis of the RISM theory at different contents of absorbed water. We find that the addition of even a relatively small amount of water leads to the strong intensification of aggregation processes observed for polar sulfonic acid (SO3H) groups. Water molecules and polar SO3H groups form mixed aggregates with a three-layer structure. Incorporation of water molecules inside the aggregates results in an increase of their stability and leads to the increase of the number of associating groups in a stable aggregate. With increasing the number of incorporated solvent molecules, the average size of mixed aggregates increases. The results obtained in the present study support the concept of an irregularly shaped cluster surfaces. Such geometries are favorable to the formation of long channels of connected water-containing aggregates providing the unique permeability characteristics of Nafion membranes. In addition, we investigate the clustering and continuum percolation in the water phase, using the formalism of pair-connectedness correlation functions. The mean cluster size found theoretically is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental estimates existing in the literature.},

We employed the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model for water, and the optimized potential for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field for TBA. The partial radial distribution functions obtained for the TBA-water mixture are in qualitative agreement with those available from neutron diffraction experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that hydrogen bonds between all species are enhanced with rise of the TBA concentration. The tetrahedral- like network of hydrogen bonding in dilute TBA aqueous solution gradually turns into the zigzag-like structure for a high TBA concentration. In dilute aqueous solution, TBA molecules cluster by the hydrophobic methyl groups, whereas their hydroxyl groups are incorporated into the water hydrogen-bonding cage surrounding the TBA aggregate. In concentrated TBA, water as well as TBA molecules associate into the zigzag-like hydrogen-bonding chains. The present work shows that the RISM/KH theory is able to qualitatively predict the association structure of alcohol-water liquid mixtures.},

We selected solutes with square- or cubic-like structures: initially all the atoms were electrically neutral and, then we applied $\delta$+and $\delta$-charges instantaneously. For the multipoles, Ss(t)s show apparent dependence on $\delta$, which predicts nonlinear response of the solvent, because Ss(t) is a normalized quantity irrespective of $\delta$ as far as the linear response of solvent dynamics is assumed.

We have found the difference between the dynamic response functions obtained from spectral widths and that from spectral peak shifts implying a nonlinear solvent-response, as these two kinds of the response functions should again correspond to each other within a linear response regime.

I then explore several other themes that stem from the collective findings from the five studies and which connect with the general landscape of the research domain. Two questions guide the domain. One question is substantive: What do we know about how syntactic complexity grows, and what factors affect this growth? The other question is methodological: How can one best measure syntactic complexity? Both, of course, are interrelated. An overarching conclusion is that much progress has been made in what is already known, substantively and methodologically. An emerging insight is that we can look forward to several areas of expansion that are imminent in the domain.},

abstract = {A Kirkwood-Buff equation for the partial molar volumes of polyatomic molecules in solutions is derived based on the reference interaction site model (RISM) theory of molecular liquids. The partial molar volume of the twenty amino acids in aqueous solution at infinite dilution are calculated using the equation, and the results are discussed in comparison with the experimental data. The results indicate that ionizations of the C- and N-terminus groups give negative contributions to the volume ranging from -3.2 cm(3)/mol to -9.7 cm(3)/mol depending on the amino acid. Ionization of the dissociable residues also give negative contribution which ranges from -3.0 cm(3)/mol to -6.0 cm(3)/mol. On the other hand, contribution of the fractional charges on atoms to the volume is not necessarily negative, but rather slightly positive with few exceptions. It is clarified that contribution from an atom group to the volume is largely dependent on the situation where the group is placed. Therefore, it is concluded that the conventional way of determining the partial molar volume from group contributions is not reliable. The theoretical results for the partial molar volume exhibit a systematic deviation from corresponding experimental data, which increases nearly proportionally with increasing temperature and with the number of atoms in the amino acids. In order to account for the deviation, a concept of the "ideal fluctuation volume" is proposed, which is the ideal gas contribution to the volume, originating from the intramolecular fluctuation of solute.

It provides a successful approach to realistic models of molecular liquids, and properly allows for the effect of a quenched disordered matrix on the sorbed liquid. The description can be extended to an electrolyte solution in a disordered material containing charged chemical functionalities that determine its adsorption character. The replica reference interaction site model (RISM) equations are complemented with the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure and its partial linearization (PLHNC), adequate to ionic and polar molecular liquids. In these approximations, the excess chemical potentials are derived in a closed analytical form. We extend the description to a quenched-annealed system with soft-core interaction potentials between all species, in which the liquid and matrix equilibrium distributions are characterized in general by two different temperatures. The replica RISM/PLHNC-HNC theory is applied to water sorbed in a quenched disordered microporous network of atoms associated into interconnected branched chains, with activating polar groups grafted to matrix chains. The results are in qualitative agreement with experiment for water confined in disordered materials.},

abstract = {The solvation free energy of polar and nonpolar molecules in water is examined using the statistical mechanical integral equation theory which was recently introduced by Beglov and Roux (J. Phys. Chem. 1997, 101, 7821). The integral equation is an extension of previous theories based on the reference interaction site model (RISM) and the hypernetted chain equation (HNC) to determine the one-dimensional site−site radial pair correlation functions. Since the integral equation provides the average density of the solvent interaction sites in three-dimensional (3d) space around a complex molecular solute of arbitrary shape, it is thereby referred to as the 3d-RISM-HNC integral equation. In the present paper, the accuracy of the 3d-RISM-HNC integral equation is examined by comparing the calculated excess solvation free energy at infinite dilution with experimental data for a set of nonpolar (n-alkanes) and polar (n-alcohols, n-carboxylic acids, and simple amides) molecules. Thermodynamic integration is used to calculate the excess solvation free energy on the basis of the average site densities obtained by the 3d-RISM-HNC equation. Two extensions were made to improve the accuracy of the integral equation. First, the susceptibility of pure liquid water (an input for calculating the excess solvation free energy of molecules in the infinite dilution limit) was obtained by combining information from a molecular dynamics simulation with the RISM-HNC integral equation. Second, empirical water hydrogen and water oxygen bridge functions were introduced and optimized for improving the accuracy of the theory. The calculated solvation free energies are in good accord with experimental data, although further work will be required for quantitatively accurate results. These preliminary results indicate that the 3d-RISM-HNC equation with well-calibrated optimized bridge functions is a promising approach for calculating the hydration free energy of complex molecules.},

abstract = {Water plays a unique role in all living organisms. Not only is it nature's ubiquitous solvent, but it also actively takes part in many cellular processes. In particular, the structure and properties of interfacial water near biomolecules such as proteins are often related to the function of the respective molecule. It can therefore be highly instructive to study the local water density around solutes in cellular systems, particularly when solvent-mediated forces such as the hydrophobic effect are relevant. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations seem well suited to study these systems at the atomic level. However, due to sampling requirements, it is not clear that MD simulations are, indeed, the method of choice to obtain converged densities at a given level of precision. We here compare the calculation of local water densities with two different methods: MD simulations and the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). In particular, we investigate the convergence of the local water density to assess the required simulation times for different levels of resolution. Moreover, we provide a quantitative comparison of the densities calculated with MD and with 3D-RISM-KH and investigate the effect of the choice of the water model for both methods. Our results show that 3D-RISM-KH yields density distributions that are very similar to those from MD up to a 0.5 {\AA} resolution, but for significantly reduced computational cost. The combined use of MD and 3D-RISM-KH emerges as an auspicious perspective for efficient solvent sampling in dynamical systems.},

Each protonated state, denoted as iH, where i = 0-4, has a different number of protonated histidines, from 0 to 4. The DF of water in each state exhibits closed structures of 0H, 1H, and 2H and open structures in 3H and 4H. In the closed form, the DF and PMF indicate that hydronium ions are excluded from the channel. In contrast, the ion can distribute throughout the opened channel. The barrier in PMF of 3H, approximately 3-5 kJ/mol, is lower than that of 4H, 5-7 kJ/mol, indicating that 3H has higher permeability to protons. On the basis of the radial DFs of water and hydronium ions around the imidazole rings of His37, we propose a new mechanism of proton transfer through the gating region of the channel. In this process, a hydronium ion hands a proton to a non-protonated histidine through a hydrogen bond between them, and then the other protonated histidine releases a proton to a water molecule via a hydrogen bond. The process transfers a proton effectively from one water molecule to another.},

This method has been available in the standard release of the Amber9 and Amber10 suite of programs. In this paper a novel implementation of this method will be discussed, in which the nudged elastic band method is applied to only a specific, user-defined subset of atoms in a particular system, returning comparable results and minimum energy pathways as the standard implementation for an alanine dipeptide test system. This allows incorporation of explicit solvent with simulated systems, which may be preferred in many cases to an implicit solvent model. From a computational standpoint, this implementation of NEB also reduces the communication overhead inside the code, resulting in better performance for larger systems.},

abstract = {The authors present an implementation of the three-dimensional reference interaction site model self-consistent-field (3D-RISM-SCF) method. First, they introduce a robust and efficient algorithm for solving the 3D-RISM equation. The algorithm is a hybrid of the Newton-Raphson and Picard methods. The Jacobian matrix is analytically expressed in a computationally useful form. Second, they discuss the solute-solvent electrostatic interaction. For the solute to solvent route, the electrostatic potential (ESP) map on a 3D grid is constructed directly from the electron density. The charge fitting procedure is not required to determine the ESP. For the solvent to solute route, the ESP acting on the solute molecule is derived from the solvent charge distribution obtained by solving the 3D-RISM equation. Matrix elements of the solute-solvent interaction are evaluated by the direct numerical integration. A remarkable reduction in the computational time is observed in both routes. Finally, the authors implement the first derivatives of the free energy with respect to the solute nuclear coordinates. They apply the present method to "solute" water and formaldehyde in aqueous solvent using the simple point charge model, and the results are compared with those from other methods: the six-dimensional molecular Ornstein-Zernike SCF, the one-dimensional site-site RISM-SCF, and the polarizable continuum model. The authors also calculate the solvatochromic shifts of acetone, benzonitrile, and nitrobenzene using the present method and compare them with the experimental and other theoretical results.},

The model requires only a small number of chemical descriptors associated with the main features of the chemical structure of solutes: excluded volume, branch, double bond, benzene ring, hydroxyl group, halogen atom, aldehyde group, ketone group, ether group, and phenol fragment. The optimum model was selected after testing of different RISM free energy expressions on a training set of 65 molecules. We show that the correction parameters of the SDC model are transferable between different chemical classes, which allows one to cover a wide range of organic solutes.

The results are completely in harmony with the experimental observations, while they are in accord with none of the molecular simulation studies. All the ions studied are hard to permeate through either of the channels. However, the reasons why the permeability is so low are different depending on the channels and the ions. In the AQP1 channel, the cations, or Na+ and H3O+, are largely excluded from the channel essentially by the electrostatic repulsion due to the positively charged residues, while the Cl- ion is blocked by a high steric barrier at the selective filter (SF) region. In the GlpF, the PMFs of Na+ and H3O+ inside the channel are mostly positive, and they have three large barriers to cross, which may be preventing the ions from permeation. On the other hand, the PMF of Cl- is largely negative, but it has wide and deep well which likely prevents the ion from permeating through the channel by "trapping" mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our results exhibited the transition from the B to Z forms with increasing salt concentrations, which is in qualitative accord with the experiments. The results indicate that the transition is caused by an interplay of essentially two contributions, which determine the stability of the molecules, the electrostatic repulsion among charged phosphate groups, and the negative free energy due to counterion binding to those groups. The result is consistent with one of the two models proposed earlier concerning the physical origin of the salt-induced transition of DNA, which attributes the phenomena to the screening of the electrostatic repulsion among phosphate groups, not to the "economy" of hydration, which has been proposed by Saenger et al.},

abstract = {As an alternative to the conventional solvation models, we propose to use the molecular theory of solvation also known as the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH) as an essential part of a multiscale approach for biomolecular modelling at nanoscale. Based on the rigorous statistical- mechanical foundation, this approach provides a natural link between different levels of coarse-graining details in the multiscale description of the solvation structure and thermodynamics, from highly localised structural solvent and bound ligand molecules to effective desolvation potentials and self-assembling nanoarchitectures. Using the 3D-RISM-KH approach, we study all stages of formation of fibrillar aggregates and amyloid fibrils. We also show that the approach is capable of predicting binding sites for the inhibitors of the pathological conversion and aggregation of prion proteins in agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {We revisit the thermodynamic and structural properties of fluids of homonuclear hard dumbbells in the framework provided by the reference interaction site model (RISM) theory of molecular fluids. Besides the previously investigated Percus-Yevick (PY) approximation, we test the accuracy of other closures to the RISM equations, imported from the theory of simple fluids; specifically, we study the hypernetted chain (HNC), the modified HNC (MHNC) and, less extensively, the Verlet approximations. We implement our approach for models characterized by several different elongations, up to the case of tangent diatomics, and investigate the whole fluid density range. The theoretical predictions are assessed against Monte Carlo simulations, either available from literature or newly generated by us. The HNC and PY equations of state, calculated via different routes, share on the whole the same level of accuracy. The MHNC is applied by enforcing an internal thermodynamic consistency constraint, leading to good predictions for the equation of state as the elongation of the dumbbell increases. As for the radial distribution function, the MHNC appears superior to other theories, especially for tangent diatomics in the high density limit; the PY approximation is better than the HNC and Verlet closures in the high density or elongation regime. Our structural analysis is supplemented by an accurate inversion procedure to reconstruct from Monte Carlo data and RISM the "exact" direct correlation function. In agreement with such calculations and consistent with the forecast of rigorous diagrammatic analysis, all theories predict the occurrence in the direct correlation function of a first cusp inside the dumbbell core and (with the obvious exception of the PY) of a second cusp outside; the cusps' heights are also qualitatively well reproduced by the theories, except at high densities.},

abstract = {A combined integral equation and quantum mechanical method, the so-called RISM-SCF method, is used to develop a self consistent effective potential model to describe pure liquid water in accordance with thermodynamic properties like chemical potential or entropy over a wide range of temperature and pressure. Since the thermodynamic excess properties calculated with the SSOZ equation are extremely charge dependent using constant Lennard-Jones parameters, we first developed a new function of the Lennard-Jones parameters of water depending on the partial charges taking into account the charge dependent polarisation which is reflected mainly by the attracting term of the Lennard-Jones potential. We used experimental data of thermodynamic excess functions at three selected temperatures in order to adjust the potential parameters reproducing these thermodynamic functions with an error smaller than 3{\%}. Using this charge dependence of the Lennard-Jones parameters we applied the RISM-SCF method to calculate thermodynamic properties of pure liquid water, especially its vapor pressure, in a temperature range from 273.16 to 423.15 K and a pressure range from 0.5 to 500 kPa. Our calculated values of the vapor pressure agree well with the experimental data, as do our values of chemical potential and entropy as function of temperature. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These show that salt bridges are too stable by as much as 3−4 kcal/mol in the GB solvent models that we tested, consistent with previously reported observations of significantly different structural ensembles in GB models and explicit solvent for proteins containing ionizable groups. We thus investigated a simple empirical correction, wherein the intrinsic GB radii of hydrogen atoms bound to charged nitrogen atoms are reduced, effectively increasing the desolvation penalty of the positively charged groups.

Geometry optimizations are performed for each electronic state in solution with the complete-active-space SCF wave functions. Dynamic electron correlation effects are taken into account by using the multiconfigurational quasidegenerate perturbation theory. Two-dimensional free energy surfaces are constructed as the function of the twisting and wagging angles of the dimethylamino group for the ground and locally excited (LE) states. The calculated absorption and fluorescence energies are in good agreement with experiments. The validity of the twisted ICT (TICT) model is confirmed in explaining the dual fluorescence, and the possibility of the planar ICT model is ruled out. To examine the mechanism of the TICT state formation, a "crossing" seam between the LE and charge-transfer (CT) state surfaces is determined. The inversion of two electronic states occurs at a relatively small twisting angle. The effect of solvent reorganization is also examined. It is concluded that the intramolecular twisting coordinate is more important than the solvent fluctuation for the TICT state formation, because the energy difference between the two states is minimally dependent on the solvent configuration.},

Isothermal-isobaric ensemble Monte Carlo simulations have been performed in order to test the new theoretical approach. In particular, simulations are performed for different ion concentrations and different ratios of the cation, anion, and solvent segment diameters. Predictions for the thermodynamic properties from the new equation of state are compared with the computer simulation data. Additionally, results from a combination of the SAFT-VR approach with Debye-Huckel theory and the primitive model are also presented and compared to those obtained with the nonprimitive model to illustrate the advantages of the new statistical associating fluid theory for potentials of variable range plus dipole and electrolytes (SAFT-VR+DE) approach. The results show that the proposed equation of state provides a good description of the PVT properties of electrolyte fluids with different sizes of ions and solvent.},

The difference of the hydration free energy between m- and r-DNiPA is estimated to be 1.2 kJ mol−1. The molecular mechanics (MM) calculations with the GB/SA model have revealed that r-DNiPA in water is more stable by ca. 1 kJ mol−1 than m-DNiPA, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental result.

The continuous solvent-site distribution is mapped onto a set of discrete background charges ("embedded cluster") that represent an additional contribution to the molecular Hamiltonian. The EC-RISM analysis of the SAMPL2 challenge set of tautomers proceeds in three stages. Firstly, the group of compounds for which quantitative experimental free energy data was provided was taken to determine appropriate levels of quantum-chemical theory for geometry optimization and free energy prediction. Secondly, the resulting workflow was applied to the full set, allowing for chemical interpretations of the results. Thirdly, disclosure of experimental data for parts of the compounds facilitated a detailed analysis of methodical issues and suggestions for future improvements of the model. Without specifically adjusting parameters, the EC-RISM model yields the smallest value of the root mean square error for the first set (0.6 kcal mol(-1)) as well as for the full set of quantitative reaction data (2.0 kcal mol(-1)) among the SAMPL2 participants.},

Comparisons are made between the models of electrolyte solution sorbed in the carbonized PVDC material and a single carbon nanosphere in bulk electrolyte solution. Particular attention is paid to the chemical potential balance between the species of the sorbed electrolyte solution and the bulk solution in contact with the nanoporous material. As a result of the strong hydrophobicity of the carbonized PVDC material in the absence of activating chemical groups, the densities of water and ions sorbed in the material are remarkably low compared to those in the ambient bulk solution. The interaction between water molecules and cations becomes strong in nanospaces. It turns out that, in carbon nanopores, a cation adsorbed at the carbon surface is fully surrounded by the hydration shell of water molecules which separates the cation and the surface. Distinctively, an anion is adsorbed in direct contact with the carbon surface, which squeezes a part of its hydration shell out. The tendency increases toward smaller cations, which are characterized as "positive hydration" ions. In the bulk, cations are not hydrated so strongly and behave similarly to anions. The results suggest that the specific capacitance of an electric double-layer supercapacitor with nanoporous electrodes is intimately related to the solvation structure of electrolyte solution sorbed in nanopores, which is affected by the microscopic structure of the nanoporous electrode.},

The equilibrium PMV is expressed simply by the conformational ensemble average of PMV. The equilibrium PMC consists of two terms: the conformational ensemble average of PMC and the mean square fluctuation of PMV along conformational axis. As an illustrative application of the theory, the equilibrium PMV and PMC of butane in aqueous solution are calculated from the relations, in which the thermodynamic quantities of each conformer appearing in the relations are obtained by the reference interaction site model theory. The conformational ensemble average of PMC is the predominant contribution to the equilibrium PMC in this particular example. Possibility of shedding light on the protein conformation in terms of PMV and PMC is discussed. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A combination of the reference interaction-site model theory and site-site Smoluchowski-Vlasov equation is applied to estimate the dynamic response function of the average-energy relaxation of the solute-solvent system, S-S(t). We calculate S-S(t) for 13 model solutes with different structure, from a simple ion to an octopole, in a polar solvent. The partial charges of the ions and multipoles are changed to investigate nonlinear character of S-S(t). The "nonlinear character" we study here corresponds to the response of the solvent fluctuation after the sudden change of the solute charge-distribution. Our present results reveal that S-S(t) depends on the molecular structure and charge distribution of the solute. S-S(t) is decomposed into two parts: one corresponding to the optical mode of solvent, the other to the acoustic mode. We show that for multipoles the optical mode is responsible for the fast part of S-S(t), while the acoustic mode plays an important role in the slower dynamics. The dual nature of S-S(t) is essential for the nonlinearity of solvation dynamics. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We present results of the theoretical study and numerical calculation of the dynamics of molecular liquids based on the combination of the memory equation formalism and the reference interaction site model (RISM). Memory equations for the site-site intermediate scattering functions are studied in the mode-coupling approximation for the first-order memory kernels, while equilibrium properties such as site-site static structure factors are deduced from RISM. The results include the temperature-density (pressure) dependence of translational diffusion coefficients D and orientational relaxation times tau for acetonitrile in water, methanol in water, and methanol in acetonitrile--all in the limit of infinite dilution. Calculations are performed over the range of temperatures and densities employing the extended simple point charge model for water and optimized site-site potentials for acetonitrile and methanol. The theory is able to reproduce qualitatively all main features of temperature and density dependences of D and tau observed in real and computer experiments. In particular, anomalous behavior, i.e, the increase in mobility with density, is observed for D and tau of methanol in water, while acetonitrile in water and methanol in acetonitrile do not show deviations from the ordinary behavior. The variety exhibited by the different solute-solvent systems in the density dependence of the mobility is interpreted in terms of the two competing origins of friction, which interplay with each other as density increases: the collisional and dielectric frictions which, respectively, increase and decrease with increasing density.},

In our previous paper, we calculated these properties by using essentially the same method in a wide range of density values (0.6-1.4 g/cm3). However, the calculation was limited at rather higher density ({\textgreater}0.6 g/cm3) due to the difficulty of convergence, which is inherent to the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure. The problem is overcome in this study by employing the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure which hybridizes the HNC and the mean-spherical approximation (MSA). Here, we present the results for the thermodynamic range of densities from 0.025 to 1.0 g/cm3 and for temperatures from 300 to 800 K including the supercritical point.},

abstract = {We examine the issue of whether dispersion forces can lead to crystallization in a system of charged nanoparticles in aqueous solution with NaCl salt. To this end, we determine the effective pair potential (EPP) among the nanoparticles starting from a model system that explicitly includes the salt ions and the water molecules, using the well-tested simple point charge extended (SPC/E) model for the latter. The two-particle correlations among the components of this model system are determined using the reference interaction site model (RISM) equation complemented with the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure. The EPP at infinite nanoparticle dilution is obtained from these correlations after contracting the salt ions and water molecules following the method presented in P. Gonzalez-Mozuelos, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 22702. The dressed-interaction-site theory (DIST) discussed in that work shows that the corresponding EPP has a short-range contribution plus a screened electrostatic (Yukawa) potential with renormalized charges and dielectric constant. A polynomial-fitting scheme is devised to quantify the dependence of the effective electrostatic paramenters on the underlying salt concentration. As such, we derive the phase diagram for our system, using a mean field approach based upon the computed EPP, for a range of (finite) nanoparticle densities and salt concentrations and demonstrate crystallization. Findings from our model also suggest the possibility of crystallization occurring preferentially among nanoparticles with negative charges than those with positive charges of the same magnitude and thus exhibiting charge asymmetry due to solvation effects.},

The method proposes the expansion of site-site correlation functions into the wavelet series and further calculations of the approximating coefficients. To solve the integral equations we have applied the hybrid scheme in which the coarse part of the solution is calculated by wavelets with the use of the Newton-Raphson procedure, while the fine part is evaluated by the direct iterations. The Coifman 2 basis set is employed for the wavelet treatment of the coarse solution. This wavelet basis set provides compact and accurate approximation of site-site correlation functions so that the number of basis functions and the amplitude of the fine part of solution decrease sufficiently with respect to those obtained by the conventional scheme. The efficiency of the method is tested by calculations of SPC/E model of water. The results indicated that the total CPU time to obtain solution by the proposed procedure reduces to 20{\%} of that required for the conventional hybrid method.},

abstract = {Asphaltene aggregation reduces bitumen upgrading efficiency by increasing bitumen viscosity and coke formation. Our approach to model asphaltene aggregation involves geometry optimisation by using the Harris approximation implemented in DMol3, followed by a solvation calculation by using the three-dimensional molecular theory of solvation (a.k.a. 3D-RISM) we have developed recently [A. Kovalenko, Three-dimensional RISM theory for molecular liquids and solid-liquid interfaces, in Understanding Chemical Reactivity: Molecular Theory of Solvation, F. Hirata ed., Vol. 24, Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York, NY, 2003, pp. 169-275]. From the Harris approximation, we obtain the Hirshfeld and Mulliken asphaltene atomic charges. The 3D-RISM theory allows one to model solvation at given temperature, solvent density and solvent composition. The theory predicts solvation structure and thermodynamic characteristics, such as the potential of mean force (PMF). We investigate the effect of the Hirshfeld and Mulliken charge calculation methods on the PMF values for asphaltene disaggregation in quinoline and 1-methylnaphthalene solvents at 298 and 473K. Our PMF results predict that asphaltene disaggregation is favoured in quinoline at 473K, whereas in 1-methylnaphthalene the asphaltene aggregate would remain undisturbed. These results are in agreement with the experiment and correlate with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results [T. Takanohashi, S. Sato, and R. Tanaka, Structural relaxation behaviors of three different asphaltenes using MD calculations, Petr. Sci. Technol. 22 (2004), pp. 901-904]. The statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM method probes the entire phase space and yields the solvation structure and thermodynamics at a much lower computational cost than MD, and thus gives access to solvation processes that occur on large time and space scales.},

Both the electron correlation effect and basis sets play an important role in the relative energies of the gauche and trans conformers in gas and solution phases. Both PCM and RISM-MP2 methods resulted in a consistent trend with the previous experimental and theoretical studies that the population of the gauche conformer increases in going from the gas phase to the aqueous solution. However, the PCM treatment could not describe the solvent effect completely in that the sign of the relative free energy of the gauche and trans forms is opposite to the most recent experimental and theoretical data, while the RISM-MP2 gives the right sign in the free energy difference. We found that the larger excess chemical potential gain (by ca. -4.1 kcal/mol) for the gauche conformer is large enough to result in the gauche preference of DCE in water, though it has to compensate for more solute reorganization energy (approximately 1.6 kcal/mol) and overcome the energy difference (approximately 1.6 kcal/mol) in the gas phase. The radial distribution functions between DCE and the nearest water shows that the electrostatic repulsion between chlorine and oxygen atoms is higher in the trans conformer than in the gauche one, while the attractive interaction between chlorine and hydrogen of water is higher in the gauche conformer.},

We present a new procedure that enables us to partition the electronic distortion energy caused by solvation into the energy contribution of each atom (or each moiety), with which one can evaluate the atomic-level change of electronic structure. In the present study, we combine the procedure with the RISM-SCF method that can treat solvent molecules explicitly. This method is successfully applied to the tautomerization of 2-pyridone in aqueous solution, whose equilibrium is known to show a marked solvation effect, and provides us a new detailed feature of this equilibrium. (1) As expected, electronic structures of oxygen and nitrogen atoms, which are strongly solvated, are distorted significantly. (2) However, the electronic distortion energies of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms are considerably compensated by the microscopic solvation. (3) One of the determining factors of the equilibrium is the carbon atom, with which the oxygen atom is bound, because the electronic distortion cannot be compensated by the microsolvation due to its rather inside position, and (4) the other factor is the distortion energy of the proton that directly relates to the equilibrium probably because the electronic structure changes too much to be compensated by microsolvation. These new findings lead to deep and correct understanding of this equilibrium.},

The method requires just the structure of protein and the potential energy parameters for the biomolecules and solutions as inputs. The calculation is carried out in two steps. The first step is to obtain the pair correlation functions for solutions consisting of water and ligands based on the RISM theory. Then, given the pair correlation functions prepared in the first step, we calculate the 3D-distribution functions of water and ligands around and inside protein based on the 3D-RISM theory. The molecular recognition of a ligand by the protein is realized by the 3D-distribution functions: if one finds some conspicuous peaks in the distribution of a ligand inside protein, then the ligand is regarded as "recognized" by the protein. Some biochemical processes are investigated, which are intimately related to the molecular recognition of small ligands including water, noble gases, and ions by a protein.},

Consequently, iterative solution of the RISM equation is not needed. The relative solvation free energies of seven different conformations of the alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution are calculated. Results from the coupled RISM/MD methodology are in good agreement with those from earlier simulations using the accurate free energy perturbation approach, showing that the alphaR conformation is most stabilized by solution.

abstract = {The equilibria of Grignard reagents, CH3MgCl and CH3MgBr, in diethyl ether (Et2O) solvent as well as the reaction of the reagents with acetone are studied theoretically. To describe the equilibria and reactions in Et2O solvent, we employ the reference interaction site model self-consistent field method with the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (RISM-MP2) free energy gradient method. Since the solvent molecules strongly coordinate to the Grignard reagents, we construct a cluster model by including several Et2O molecules into the quantum mechanical region and embed it into the bulk solvent. We propose that, instead of the traditionally accepted cyclic dimer, the linear form of dimer is as stable as the monomer pair and participates in the equilibria. For the reaction with acetone, two important reaction paths (i.e., monomeric and linear dimeric paths) are studied. It is found that the barrier height for the monomeric path is much higher than that for the linear dimeric path, indicating that the reaction of the Grignard reagent with acetone proceeds through the linear dimeric reaction path. The change of solvation structure during the reaction is examined. On the basis of the calculated free energy profiles, the entire reaction mechanisms of the Grignard reagents with aliphatic ketones in Et2O solvent are discussed.},

This is accomplished by extending the framework of the dressed ion theory to describe the formal solution of the reference interaction site model integral equations. It is shown here that these EPPs have in the asymptotic limit the expected Coulomb form, even for finite concentrations of the solute. At shorter distances, the molecular structure of the solvent induces noticeable deviations of the EPPs from the reference potentials corresponding to an analogous model system with a structureless dielectric background. These deviations remain almost invariant over the whole range of concentrations considered here. These EPPs are therefore suitable to be used as the input for computer simulations at the McMillan-Mayer level. We also analyze with some detail the consequences of the short range behavior of the EPPs involving multivalent ions.},

At present, the most common approach is based on the free energy difference evaluated in dielectric continuum model for pure water, epsilon=80, which completely ignores ionic influence, i.e., ionic strength. In the present paper, a molecular level theory to predict pKa is proposed based on the reference interaction site model, which is a statistical mechanics for molecular liquids. By regarding an acidic aqueous solution as a three component system including water, proton species (cation), and anion, aqueous solutions with desired pH can be theoretically realized by controlling the number density of the proton species. Using computed free energy changes on the deprotonation of glycine at various pH conditions, a titration curve and pKa can be obtained from the first principle, showing excellent agreement with experimental data. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical attempt to directly evaluate pKa under the condition where ionic influence is explicitly taken into account by using statistical molecular theory.},

We found an inconsistency between the rank-1 reorientational correlation functions of different vectors on a molecule when the molecule is nearly planar. We show that it is because the coupling between the torque and the acceleration of different rotational modes is missing in the theory. A modification of the theory is proposed to incorporate this coupling, and the inconsistency between the reorientational correlation functions is remedied by the modification. We also apply the modified theory to the reorientational motion of water. The rotational part of the memory function becomes greater compared with the conventional theory, and it approaches to that from the molecular dynamics simulation. The charge-current spectrum of water is also shown to be improved by the modification. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Using the polymer integral equation method, we study the solution properties of charged quasi-random two-letter (HP) copolymers with two different types of distribution of monomer units along a copolymer chain: proteinlike copolymers and random-block copolymers. The copolymers consist of monomer units of two types: associating electroneutral hydrophobic (H) units and charged (P) units. Small mobile counterions are treated explicitly. We explore the influence of the primary structure of HP-polyelectrolyte chains on their structural behavior and aggregation in a solution, which is poor for H units and good for P units. Analysis of the static structure factors shows that there is an evident tendency to the aggregation of the hydrophobic groups belonging to different macromolecules into spatially correlated clusters. The spinodal lines and various structure diagrams are calculated for both copolymers. The characteristic temperature of counterion condensation is also estimated. The main finding is that charged proteinlike copolymers are more prone to self-organization in a poor solvent than their random-block counterparts. In particular, the apparent spinodal temperatures for proteinlike copolymers are several fold larger than for random-block copolymers with the same average block length and HP composition. The influence of the primary structure is more pronounced in the processes dominated by short-range hydrophobic interaction than in the processes mostly governed by long-range electrostatic interactions.

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. It was found that amyloidogenic oligomers, not mature fibrils, are neurotoxic agents related to these diseases. Molecular mechanisms of infectivity, pathways of aggregation, and molecular structure of these oligomers remain elusive. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics, molecular mechanics combined with solvation analysis by statistical-mechanical, three-dimensional molecular theory of solvation (also known as 3D-RISM-KH) in a new MM-3D-RISM-KH method to study conformational stability, and association thermodynamics of small wild-type A$\beta$17-42 oligomers with different protonation states of Glu 22, as well the E22Q (Dutch) mutants. The association free energy of small $\beta$-sheet oligomers shows near-linear trend with the dimers being thermodynamically more stable relative to the larger constructs. The linear (within statistical uncertainty) dependence of the association free energy on complex size is a consequence of the unilateral stacking of monomers in the $\beta$-sheet oligomers. The charge reduction of the wild-type A$\beta$17-42 oligomers upon protonation of the solvent-exposed Glu22 at acidic conditions results in lowering the association free energy compared to the wild-type oligomers at neutral pH and the E22Q mutants. The neutralization of the peptides because of the E22Q mutation only marginally affects the association free energy, with the reduction of the direct electrostatic interactions mostly compensated by the unfavorable electrostatic solvation effects. For the wild-type oligomers at acidic conditions such compensation is not complete, and the electrostatic interactions, along with the gas-phase nonpolar energetic and the overall entropic effects, contribute to the lowering of the association free energy. The differences in the association thermodynamics between the wild-type A$\beta$17-42 oligomers at neutral pH and the Dutch mutants, on the one hand, and the A$\beta$ 17-42 oligomers with protonated Glu22 , on the other, may be explained by destabilization of the inter- and intrapeptide salt bridges between Asp23 and Lys28. Peculiarities in the conformational stability and the association thermodynamics for the different models of the A$\beta$17-42 oligomers are rationalized based on the analysis of the local physical interactions and the microscopic solvation structure. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {In line with the recent development of fragment-based drug design, a new computational method for mapping of small ligand molecules on protein surfaces is proposed. The method uses three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution functions of the atomic sites of the ligand calculated using the molecular theory of solvation, known as the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory, to identify the most probable binding modes of ligand molecules. The 3D-RISM-based method is applied to the binding of several small organic molecules to thermolysin, in order to show its efficiency and accuracy in detecting binding sites. The results demonstrate that our method can reproduce the major binding modes found by X-ray crystallographic studies with sufficient precision. Moreover, the method can successfully identify some binding modes associated with a known inhibitor, which could not be detected by X-ray analysis. The dependence of ligand-binding modes on the ligand concentration, which essentially cannot be treated with other existing computational methods, is also investigated. The results indicate that some binding modes are readily affected by the ligand concentration, whereas others are not significantly altered. In the former case, it is the subtle balance in the binding affinity between the ligand and water that determines the dominant ligand-binding mode.},

abstract = {For nine solvents of various polarity (from cyclohexane to water), the solvatochromic shifts of the lowest absorption band of coumarin 153 are evaluated using a computational method based on frozen-density embedding theory [Wesolowski and Warshel, J. Chem Phys., 1993, 97, 9050, and subsequent articles]. In the calculations, the average electron density of the solvent [linear span]$\rho$(B)(r[combining right harpoon above])[linear span] is used as the frozen density. [linear span]$\rho$(B)(r[combining right harpoon above])[linear span] is evaluated using the statistical-mechanical approach introduced in Kaminski et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 2010, 114, 6082. The small deviations between experimental and calculated solvatochromic shifts (the average deviation equals to about 0.02 eV), confirm the adequacy of the key approximations applied: (a) in the evaluation of the average effect of the solvent on the excitation energy, using the average density of the solvent instead of averaging the shifts over statistical ensemble and (b) using the approximant for the bi-functional of the non-electrostatic component of the orbital-free embedding potential, are adequate for chromophores which interact with the environment by non-covalent bonds. The qualitative analyses of the origin of the solvatochromic shifts are made using the graphical representation of the orbital-free embedding potential.},

abstract = {The partial molar volume (PMV) change associated with the pressure-induced structural transition of ubiquitin is analyzed by the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory of molecular solvation. The theory predicts that the PMV decreases upon the structural transition, which is consistent with the experimental observation. The volume decomposition analysis demonstrates that the PMV reduction is primarily caused by the decrease in the volume of structural voids in the protein, which is partially canceled by the volume expansion due to the hydration effects. It is found from further analysis that the PMV reduction is ascribed substantially to the penetration of water molecules into a specific part of the protein. Based on the thermodynamic relation, this result implies that the water penetration causes the pressure-induced structural transition. It supports the water penetration model of pressure denaturation of proteins proposed earlier.},

Despite the neglect of edge effects, the simpler PRISM theory yields results in good agreement with the more elaborate RISM calculations, provided the correct form factor, characterizing the intramolecular structure of the platelets, is used. The RISM equation of state is sensitive to the number of sites used to model the platelets, but saturates when the hard spheres, associated with the interaction sites, nearly touch; the limiting equation of state agrees reasonably well with available simulation data for all densities up to the isotropic-nematic transition. When properly scaled with the second virial coefficient, the equations of state of platelets with different aspect ratios nearly collapse on a single master curve.},

In this combined method, the integral equation theory 3d-RISM-HNC (J. Phys. Chem.

The Schrodinger equation of the solute molecule in solvent background charges was solved with the quantum mechanical SCF Hartree-Fock (HF) method. The electrostatic potentials were calculated using the electronic density of the solute, which can be fitted to the atomic ESP charges. Those charges were, in turn, used in 3d-RISM-HNC calculations, which were solved iteratively. We have seen a significant increase in the solute dipole moment and the solute-solvent electrostatic interaction energy. In the case study of N-methyl amine in liquid water, we observed higher hydrogen density of water near O(CO) and higher oxygen density of water near H(NH). It has been shown that the mutual polarization between solute and solvent has significant effect on the thermodynamic properties.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition (MR) is an essential elementary process allowing biomolecules to perform their function. MR can be defined as a molecular process in which one or several guest molecules are bound with a high probability at a particular site such as a cleft or a cavity, of a host molecule in a particular orientation. It is a thermodynamic process which is characterised by the difference of the free energies between two states of a host–guest system, bound and unbound. The process features an extremely heterogeneous atomic-environment around binding sites, which has turned away challenges by the conventional statistical mechanics of liquids, e.g. a mean field theory. We have been developing a new theory for MR in biomolecular systems, based on the statistical mechanics of liquids, or the 3D-reference interaction site model (RISM)/RISM theory. The theory has demonstrated its amazing capability of predicting the process from the first principle. In this article, we review our recent works on MR concerning protein and deoxyribonucleic acid. Some applications of the method to drug design are also presented.},

While in the case of the simple atomic sphere systems this involves cubic polynomials, in the analogous hard-sphere polymer system this leads to quintic polynomials.

The RISM theory is used for the static features of the solute - solvent system, whereas MCT is employed to capture solvent dynamics. We calculate the dynamic response function of the average-energy relaxation of the system, S-S(t), a corresponding quantity which is experimentally measured through the dynamic Stokes shift of fluorescence spectra, for example. The RISM - MCT framework turns out to be very applicable for realistic estimation of S-S(t). We vary the model solutes from a simple ion, to dumbbell dipoles, to quadrupole, to octapole. As a general feature, S-S(t) begins to relax with the initial Gaussian decay, followed by the underdamped oscillation. Higher multiplicity of the pole or larger charges put on the solute-site causes S-S(t) to relax more slowly. We suggest this behavior is related to an increased complexity of solvent solvent interactions just around the charged sites on the solute. On the other hand, the amplitude of the underdamped oscillation becomes smaller as the multiplicity of the pole increases.},

When the scaling second-order DCF is imported into a recently proposed LTDFA-based polymer DFT approach, an originally associated adjustable but mathematically meaningless parameter now becomes mathematically meaningful, i.e., the numerical value lies now between 0 and 1. When the adjustable parameter-free version of the LTDFA is used instead of the LTDFA, i.e., the adjustable parameter is fixed at 0.5, the resultant parameter-free version of the scaling LTDFA-based polymer DFT is also in good agreement with the corresponding simulation data for density profiles. The parameter-free version of the scaling LTDFA-based polymer DFT is employed to investigate the density profiles of a freely jointed tangent hard sphere chain near a variable sized central hard sphere, again the predictions reproduce accurately the simulational results. Importance of the present adjustable parameter-free version lies in its combination with a recently proposed universal theoretical way, in the resultant formalism, the contact theorem is still met by the adjustable parameter associated with the theoretical way. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The three-dimensional reference interaction site model integral equation theory (3D-RISM) combined with the ab initio molecular orbital method (3D-RISM-SCF) is applied to a solvated macromolecular system. The solvation structure around a solute molecule is obtained from the 3D-RISM integral equation under the electrostatic potential of the solute molecule, calculated by the ab initio molecular orbital theory. The electrostatic potential should be calculated on each grid point in the three-dimensional real space. Therefore, the calculation of the electrostatic potential is the most time consuming part in this method. In this article, we propose a new procedure to save the computational cost for calculating the electrostatic potential and the solvated fock matrix. The strategy of this procedure is to evaluate the electrostatic potential and the solvated fock matrix in different ways, depending on the distance between solute and solvent. Inside the repulsive cores of solute atoms, it is possible to avoid the calculation of electrostatic potential and solvated Fock matrix by assuming the potential to be infinity. In the region sufficiently far from solute, they are evaluated classically by putting the effective point charge on each atom. In the intermediate region, the electrostatic potential is evaluated directly by integrating the molecular orbitals of the solute molecule. The electronic structure and the energy gradient of Methionine-Enkephalin and solvation structure are estimated by using this procedure in aqueous solution, and are compared with the results from other procedures. The results are compared also with those from the continuum model.},

The theoretical predictions are systematically compared with molecular dynamics simulations both at ambient conditions and along a few supercritical isotherms. RISM results for the liquid-vapor phase separation are also obtained and assessed against available Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo data. At ambient conditions, the theoretical correlations weakly depend on the specific details of the molecular models and reproduce the simulation results with different degrees of accuracy, depending on the pair of interaction sites considered. The position and the strength of the hydrogen bond are quite satisfactorily predicted. RISM results for the internal energy are almost quantitative whereas the pressure is generally overestimated. As for the liquid-vapor phase coexistence, RISM predictions for the vapor branch and for the critical temperature are quite accurate; on the other side, the liquid branch densities, and consequently the critical density, are underestimated. We discuss our results in terms of intrinsic limitations, and suitable improvements, of the RISM approach in describing the physical properties of polar fluids, and in the perspective of a more general investigation of mixtures of methanol with nonpolar fluids of specific interest in the physics of associating fluids.},

Although high-resolution crystal structure analyses have given us a view of tightly bound water molecules on their surface, the structural data are still insufficient to capture the detailed configurations of water molecules around the surface of these biomolecules. Thanks to the invention of various computational algorithms, computer simulations can now provide an atomic view of hydration. Here, we describe the apparent patterns of DNA hydration calculated by using two different computational methods: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory. Both methods are promising for obtaining hydration properties, but until now there have been no thorough comparisons of the calculated three-dimensional distributions of hydrating water. This rigorous comparison showed that MD and 3D-RISM provide essentially similar hydration patterns when there is sufficient sampling time for MD and a sufficient number of conformations to describe molecular flexibility for 3D-RISM. This suggests that these two computational methods can be used to complement one another when evaluating the reliability of the calculated hydration patterns.},

abstract = {The free energy change associated with the coil-to-native structural transition of protein G in aqueous solution is calculated by using the molecular theory of solvation, also known as the three-dimensional reference interaction site model theory, to uncover the molecular mechanism of protein folding. The free energy is decomposed into the protein intramolecular energy, the hydration energy, and the hydration entropy. The folding is accompanied with a large gain in the protein intramolecular energy. However, it is almost canceled by the correspondingly large loss in the hydration energy due to the dehydration, resulting in the total energy gain about an order of magnitude smaller than might occur in vacuum. The hydration entropy gain is found to be a substantial driving force in protein folding. It is comparable with or even larger than the total energy gain. The total energy gain coupled with the hydration entropy gain is capable of suppressing the conformational entropy loss in the folding. Based on careful analysis of the theoretical results, the authors present a challenging physical picture of protein folding where the overall folding process is driven by the water entropy effect.},

Since it is possible to perform RISM-calculations at very small electrolyte concentrations we compared the concentration dependence of the chemical excess potential with the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel limiting law. In general the concentration dependence of the chemical excess potential of the electrolytes follows the square-root law of Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel. The slopes of these functions, however, need a very individual discussion. The HNC-closure relation yields a much too large slope due to the overwhelming electrostatic interaction, whereas the closure relation of Kovalenko and Hirata gives very promising results for atomic ions. According to the deficiencies of the RISM model of the SSOZ-theory the slope furnishes only a dielectric constant of water according to this model. Molecular ions, however, show larger deviations from the postulated concentration dependence.},

The MRI data were collected and retrospectively reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 926 patients diagnosed with migraine, 375 patients had MRIs and 115 had abnormalities, of which 39 had WMLs. Among them, 24 (6{\%} of migraine) patients had incidental white matter findings without known neurovascular disease, risk factors, or etiologies for WMLs. The prevalence of WMLs is more common in migraine with aura (10{\%}) than without aura (4{\%}) (p = 0.038), but it is not statistically significant compared with controls (4{\%}) (p = 0.119). Deep WMLs are more prevalent than periventricular lesions; these are detected mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes. No lesions appeared to be infarct-like lesions. There was no association between the total lesion load and chronicity or the frequency of migraine. WMLs are nonprogressive. Pediatric migraineurs with aura do not develop stroke, based on the available follow-up data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: WMLs in pediatric patients with migraine and aura are no more prevalent than in controls.

abstract = {It is usually assumed that the Flory−Huggins interaction parameter $\chi$ in polymer blends can be represented by a structureless, pointlike interaction. On a local scale, however, the Flory−Huggins parameter must show a spatial dependence as it basically reflects the segment−segment interaction potential. We show that SANS can be used to access this spatial dependence and that even in the SANS regime, a pronounced Q dependence of $\chi$ is found. The polymer blend used in the experiments was a polystyrene/poly(p-methylstyrene) blend. As we did not want to rely on literature values for the segment lengths of PS and PPMS, respectively, we measured the isotope blends of h-PS/d-PS and h-PPMS/d-PPMS separately. A modified random phase formula based on the PRISM theory of Schweizer and Chandler is used to evaluate the data and fit a simple model to $\chi$(Q). We find that the range of a Yukawa-like segment−segment interaction potential is about 9 {\AA}.},

abstract = {Atheory on the time development of the density and current fields of simple fluids under an external field is formulated through the generalized Langevin formalism. The theory is applied to the linear solvation dynamics of a fixed solute regarding the solute as the external field on the solvent. The solute-solvent-solvent three-body correlation function is taken into account through the hypernetted-chain integral equation theory, and the time correlation function of the random force is approximated by that in the absence of the solute. The theoretical results are compared with those of molecular-dynamics ?MD? simulation and the surrogate theory. As for the transient response of the density field, our theory is shown to be free from the artifact of the surrogate theory that the solvent can penetrate into the repulsive core of the solute during the relaxation.We have also found a large quantitative improvement of the solvation correlation function compared with the surrogate theory. In particular, the short-time part of the solvation correlation function is in almost perfect agreement with that from the MD simulation, reflecting that the short-time expansion of the theoretical solvation correlation function is exact up to t2 with the exact three-body correlation function. A quantitative improvement is found in the long-time region, too. Our theory is also applied to the force-force time correlation function of a fixed solute, and similar improvement is obtained, which suggests that our present theory can be a basis to improve the mode-coupling theory on the solute diffusion.},

The intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) and the ultrafast solvent inertial relaxation should account for the faster decay, while the slower decay is attributed to the diffusive solvent relaxation.

abstract = {The free energy and the solvation structures of the G-quadruplex telomeric DNA in pure water and in the 0.1 M aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium chlorides are calculated on the basis of the 3D-RISM theory. To find the most stable structure of each G-quadruplex in the aqueous solutions, the free energy is minimized in the solutions on the basis of the quasi-Newton method using the analytical derivative of the solvation free energy obtained from 3D-RISM. In pure water, the chair-type conformation was found to be the most stable structure, which is followed by basket-, hybrid-, and propeller-type structures in the order. It is clarified that the order of the stability is determined essentially by the solvation free energy, not by the conformational energy. The order of the stability changes in 0.1 M NaCl solutions from that in pure water. The basket-type structure becomes the most stable one in the electrolyte solution. The theoretical finding is consistent with the experimental observation due to NMR. The reversed order of the conformational stability was attributed to the salt effect, especially, to that from the Na(+) ions bound at interstrand spaces of DNA. Concerning the conformational stability in KCl solutions, which has not been clarified yet by experiments, our results predict that the order is not changed from that in pure water; that is, the chair-type is the most stable one. The finding suggests that the effect of the potassium ion upon the structure is not so strong as the sodium ion to change the order of the stability determined in pure water. The result is consistent with our finding for RDFs of the ions bound at the interstrand spaces in DNA, which indicates clearly that the affinity of K(+) to the binding site is weaker than that of Na(+).},

We obtain the total free energy profiles in both the ground and excited states with respect to variation in the torsion angle between the phenoxide and pyridinium rings. We analyze the effect of solvent on the variation of the Solute dipole moment and oil the charge transfer character in the excited state. In the gas phase, it is shown that the potential energy profile in the excited-state decreases monotonically toward a perpendicular ring orientation and the dipole moment decreases along with decreasing charge localization. In water, the free energy surface for twisting is better characterized as nearly flat along the same coordinate for sterically accessible angles. These results are analyzed in terms of contributions of the solvation free energy, the solute electronic energy, and their coupling. Correspondingly, the dependence of the charge transfer character on Solute geometry and solvation are analyzed, and the important roles in the excitation and subsequent relaxation processes for the betaine dye are discussed. It is found that there is considerable solute electronic reorganization associated with the evolution of solvation in the excited state, and it is suggested that this reorganization may contribute significantly to the early time evolution of transient spectra following photoexcitation.},

Long homopolymer chains are modelled as 'ultrasoft colloids', with the effective interaction between their centres of mass (CM) determined by averaging over polymer conformations for fixed CM-CM distances. Diblock copolymers are modelled as `ultrasoft dumbells', with the CMs of the two strands tethered by an anharmonic intramolecular potential. Monte Carlo simulations of these coarse-grained models allow the self-assembly of model diblock copolymers into lamellar and micellar microphases to be investigated. We show that the onset of clustering of two athermal models of diblock copolymers can be predicted within the 'reference interaction site model' (RISM) integral equation theory for the pair structure, using the simple random phase closure assumption. This analytic formulation highlights the natural link between bulk phase separation of binary polymer mixtures and microphase separation of the corresponding diblock copolymer in the same selective solvent.},

Preliminary and partial results of the study have been already published (Yoshida, N. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 12042-12043). The calculation was carried out for aqueous solutions of three different electrolytes, CaCl2, NaCl, and KCl, and for four different mutants of the human lysozyme: wild type, Q86D, A92D, and Q86D/A92D, which have been studied experimentally. The discussion of this article focuses on the cleft that consists of amino acid residues from Q86 to A92. For the wild type of protein in the aqueous solutions of all the electrolytes studied, there are no distributions observed for the ions inside the cleft. The Q86D mutant shows essentially the same behavior with that of the wild type. The A92D mutant shows strong binding ability to Na+ in the recognition site, which is in accord with the experimental results. There are two isomers of the Q86D/A92D mutant, e.g., apo-Q86D/A92D and holo-Q86D/A92D. Although both isomers exhibit the binding ability to the Na+ and Ca2+ ions, the holo isomer shows much greater affinity compared with the apo isomer. Regarding the selective ion binding of the holo-Q86D/A92D mutant, it shows greater affinity to Ca2+ than to Na+, which is also consistent with the experimental observation.},

A systematic procedure is devised to determine all the quantities involved in the present Hamiltonian by the RISM-SCF electronic structure calculations for reaction systems combined with molecular dynamics simulations for bulk solvents. The present model is applied to the Menshutkin-type reactions between NH3 and methylhalides CH3X (X=Cl, Br, and I) in aqueous solution. The barrier height becomes lower with the increase of the size of leaving halogen atom, and the calculated activation energy for the CH3I reaction is in a good agreement with the experiment. The magnitude of the time dependent as well as the static solvent friction is CH3Cl{\textless}CH3Br{\textless}CH3I in the increasing order. The frequency dependent solute-solvent coupling term is found to be almost a linear function of the reaction coordinate. The transmission coefficient is estimated to be 0.84, 0.81, and 0.60, respectively, for the reactions of CH3Cl,CH3Br, and CH3I by trajectory calculations with the present reaction path Hamiltonian model.

abstract = {We studied the electronic structure of the binding site of the streptavidin-biotin complex by using the ONIOM method at the HF/STO-3G:UFF level and obtained the solvation structure of the complex by using the statistical-mechanical, three-dimensional molecular theory of solvation (aka three-dimensional reference interaction site model, 3D-RISM-KH). All the streptavidin residues located within 3 A of the biotin residue were included in the quantum mechanical (QM) layer. In total, 16 residues including biotin with 274 atoms were in the QM layer, in which five residues are responsible for the hydrophobic interactions and nine residues for the hydrogen-bonding/electrostatic interaction with biotin. We found a geometry change of the urea moiety of the biotin bound in the network of van der Waals and polar interactions. Compared to the isolated biotin, the bridging C-C bond of the biotin urea moiety in the binding site increases in length as a result of the pi-sigma interaction with the surrounding streptavidin Trp residues. This extends the previous picture of the geometry change from the ureido group to the whole bicyclic urea moiety. We have evaluated the performance of 15 density functional methods and 11 basis sets by single point calculation for the binding energy of the optimized cooperative binding complex structure. Closest to the experimental value of 18.3 kcal/mol is the binding free energy of 19.6 kcal/mol obtained for the AN model at B3LYP/6-31G(d):UFF//HF/STO-3G:UFF level. The hybrid DFT methods with enhanced assessment for nonbonded interactions such as PBE1PBE, MPW1B95, and MPWB1K can also give accurate binding energy with the use of diffuse functionals (i.e., mPWB1K/6-31+G(d)). The 3D hydration structure of the unliganded streptavidin and the streptavidin-biotin complex obtained by using the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation shows there is one immobilized water molecule at the biotin urea moiety, acting as a water bridge between the sulfur and the nitrogen of the NH group close to Ser45. This suggests that, in the docking process, biotin replaces six of the seven water molecules attached to the unliganded streptavidin binding site, and one remaining water molecule is squeezed into the gap between the Btn, Tyr43, Ser45, Trp92, and Trp79 residues in the binding pocket.},

The temperature dependence of the reorganization energy, the coupling strength, and the activation barrier is evaluated in both acetonitrile and methanol. The reorganization energy and the activation barrier decrease with increasing temperature for both cases.

abstract = {We present results of the theoretical description of ultrasonic phenomena in molecular liquids. In particular, we are interested in the development of a microscopical, i.e., statistical-mechanical, framework capable of explaining the long living puzzle of excess ultrasonic absorption in liquids. Typically, an ultrasonic wave in a liquid can be generated by applying a periodically alternating external pressure with an angular frequency that corresponds to the ultrasound. If the perturbation introduced by such a process is weak, its statistical-mechanical treatment can be done with the use of a linear response theory. We treat the liquid as a system of interacting sites, so that all the response/aftereffect functions as well as the energy dissipation and generalized (wave-vector and frequency-dependent) ultrasonic absorption coefficient are obtained in terms of familiar site-site static and time correlation functions such as static structure factors or intermediate scattering functions. To express the site-site intermediate scattering functions, we refer to the site-site memory equations in the mode-coupling approximation for first-order memory kernels, while equilibrium properties such as site-site static structure factors, and direct and total correlation functions are deduced from the integral equation theory of molecular liquids known as RISM, or one of its generalizations. All of the formalism is phrased in a general manner, hence the results obtained are expected to work for arbitrary types of molecular liquids including simple, ionic, polar, and nonpolar liquids.},

abstract = {A renormalization of the 3D-RISM-HNC integral equation is used to study the solvent and ion distributions at neutral and negatively charged planar atomistic surfaces. The charge density of the surfaces ranged from 0.0 to 0.4116 C/m(2), and the modeled electrolyte solutions consist of the salts NaCl, KCl, and CsCl at concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, and 1.0 M in SPC/E water. The results are qualitatively compared to the results from other integral equation methods and simulations for similar models. We find that the 3D-IEs predict an electric multilayer screening behavior in the solvent and ion distributions in contrast to the double layer anticipated from Poisson-Boltzmann theory. It is observed that the cation size has a significant effect on the distributions near the surface up to three solvation layers beyond which the behavior is the same among the different cations. The response of the distributions to the charged surface is described as an increase in ion and solvent density near the wall. The higher concentration solutions screen the electrostatic source more strongly at the wall as expected. The importance of ion-solvent and ion-ion correlations near the surface is shown through three-body correlation functions which are obtainable from the 3D-IEs in this study.},

The design of templated materials requires a molecular understanding of the templating effect on the material structure and performance. We present here a theoretical description of adsorption in a model templated porous material. Our model material is a quenched, equilibrated mixture of template and matrix molecular species where the template component has been subsequently removed. We propose a set of site-site [i.e., reference interaction site model (RISM)] replica Ornstein-Zernike equations relating the correlation functions of template, matrix, and adsorbing fluid molecules. To test this approach, we focus here on systems interacting via hard-sphere site-site potentials and employ a Percus-Yevick closure. We consider chain and cluster species composed of up to five spheres and observe a range of effects associated with template structure, including higher affinity toward, and enhanced templating by, compact cluster molecules. We assess these effects by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation and discuss their implication to the design of templated molecular recognition materials.},

Our study encompasses the whole concentration range, by including the pure component limits. We majorly focus on an analysis of partial, total, and concentration-concentration structure factors, and examine in detail the k--{\textgreater}0 limits of these functions. Simulation results confirm the tendency of methanol to self-associate with the formation of ring structures in the high dilution regime of this species, in agreement with experimental studies and with previous simulations by other authors. This behavior emerges as strongly related to the high nonideality of the mixture, a quantitative estimate of which is provided in terms of concentration fluctuation correlations, through the structure factors examined. The interaggregate correlation distance is also thereby estimated. Finally, the compressibility of the mixture is found in good agreement with experimental data. The RISM predictions are throughout assessed against simulation; the theory describes better the apolar solvent than the alcohol properties. Self-association of methanol is qualitatively reproduced, though this trend is much less marked in comparison with simulation results.},

The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {The free energies of reaction or activation for many systems respond in a common fashion to a perturbing parameter, such as the concentration of an "inert" additive. Arrhenius plots as a function of the perturbing parameter display a "'compensation temperature" at which the free energy appears to be independent of the perturber, an entropy-enthalpy compensation process. Thus, as the perturber's concentration varies, Arrhenius plots of the rate constant or equilibrium constant exhibit a rotation about the fixed compensation temperature. While this (isokinetic/isoequilibrium) component of the phenomenon of entropy-enthalpy compensation appears in a huge number of situations of relevance to chemistry, biology, and materials science, statistical mechanical descriptions have been almost completely lacking. We provide the general statistical mechanical basis for solvent induced isokinetic/isoequilibrium entropy-enthalpy compensation in chemical reactions and adsorption, understanding that can be used to control of rate processes and binding constants in diverse applications. The general behavior is illustrated with an analytical solution for the dilute gas limit.},

The molecular version is derived from a refinement of the method for simple fluids. In doing so, a method is proposed which appropriately couples an optimized closure with the variant of the diagrammatically proper integral equation recently introduced by this laboratory [K. M. Dyer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 123, 204512 (2005)]. The simplicity of the expressions involved in this proposed theory has allowed the authors to obtain an analytic expression for the approximate excess chemical potential. This is shown to be an efficient tool to estimate, from first principles, the numerical value of the interpolation parameters defining the aforementioned closure. As a preliminary test, representative models for simple fluids and homonuclear diatomic Lennard-Jones fluids were analyzed, obtaining site-site correlation functions in excellent agreement with simulation data.},

The solvation structures of alanine dipeptide in its seven conformations: C-7eq, C-7ax, C-5, alpha(R), beta, alpha(L) and P-II, in aqueous solution are analyzed at the atomic level in terms of the atomic solute-solvent radial distribution functions. At a temperature of T=298.15 K and bulk water density rho=0.9970 g cm(-3), the corresponding solvation free energies are calculated by using Singer and Chandler's analytic solvation free energy formulation [Mol. Phys. 55, 621 (1985)]. Solvation energies, enthalpies, and entropies are also calculated in the RISM theory framework. The conformational dependence of solvation for alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution is analyzed. The solvation thermodynamcs for alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution are mainly controlled by the strong hydrophobic groups: CH3 and CH, which make alanine dipeptide show strong hydrophobicity. But the differences in the solvation thermodynamics for different alanine dipeptide conformers are controlled by the carbonyl groups and amide groups, which make alanine dipeptide show some hydrophilicity and exist in various conformations in aqueous solution. Solvation of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution is determined by the competition among the molecular packing effects, intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the two folded C-7 conformations, the two most favorable conformations in gas phase become the least solvated in aqueous solution. Due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, C-5, P-II, alpha(L), alpha(R), and beta become more solvated in aqueous solution. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

Thanks to this strategy, time-consuming 3D fast Fourier transformation, which is required in 3D-RISM theory, can be avoided and high-parallel performance is achieved. The method is applied to small molecular systems for comparison with 3D-RISM. The obtained results by the present method and by 3D-RISM show good agreement.

abstract = {Aqueous RbF solutions have been investigated at ambient conditions by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) over the concentration range of 0 ≤ c/M ≤ 5 and by statistical mechanics (RISM integral equation theory) in the concentration range of 2.15-9.18 M. The behavior of the dielectric spectra and their characteristic parameters (dispersion amplitudes and relaxation times) is discussed, as well as the pair correlation functions and partial coordination numbers derived from statistical mechanics. The paper focuses on the influence of salt concentration on the features of ion hydration and association. The observed changes in the dielectric properties indicate a decrease of the effective hydration number from ∼ 15-18 at infinite dilution to ∼ 3.5 at 5 M and possibly weak association involving stable ion pairs at c ≤ 0.5 M. A major finding is that both ions, Rb+and F-, slow down surrounding water molecules, leading to the emergence of a separate "slow water" relaxation in the spectra. According to the analysis of RISM equilibrium properties, an average number of ∼ 6 water molecules coordinates both Rb+and F-at c = 2.15 M. This number decreases by ∼ 19{\%} for the cation and by ∼ 10{\%} for the anion as c growths up to 9.18 M.

Phys. Lett. 2003, 381, 362; J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 121, 2187) to study the hydration effect upon the tautomeric equilibria of 2-hydroxypyridine and 2-oxopyridine and of cytosine in water. In this methodology, simulation trajectories of solvated systems are computed and averaged to determine radial distribution functions, which are then inserted into a RISM expression for the solvation free energy. The computed differences in free energy of hydration for the two tautomerizations agree well with the experimental data as well as results from previous free-energy simulations. This is particularly encouraging since the coupled RISM/MD method requires a single MD simulation as compared to the more complicated and computationally demanding free-energy simulation methods.},

In this paper, two methods are presented that are promising for high-dimensional model inversion. The methods draw on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and yield reduced models that describe a truncated behavior of the original model. We utilize POD differently for the two methods, which differ in efficiency and implementation. The first method (RIGM) applies a POD to an existing partial differential equation; the second method (RISM) applies it to an autoregressive formulation of a discrete model. Both methods were applied to several synthetic cases and a real-world case with synthetic measurements and by comparing them to classic inverse methodologies (i.e., the method of finite differences and the adjoint method). The two POD methods appeared to be computationally robust and more efficient for a wide range of prior estimates. Moreover, the implementation of an adjoint for the RISM method is easy},

Native and denatured conformations of SNase are produced by using molecular dynamics simulations in water, and the PMV is obtained from the integral equation theory of molecular liquids called 3D-RISM, which is based on statistical mechanics. The PMV of the native SNase in water predicted by 3D-RISM theory is in good agreement with experiment. The PMV changes associated with pressure denaturation in water and in water-urea and water-glycerol mixtures are qualitatively reproduced. By analyzing the results obtained, we found two interesting cosolvent effects on the PMV: (1) both urea and glycerol cosolvents increase the PMVs of both native and denatured SNase compared to those in water and (2) both urea and glycerol cosolvents increase the PMV of denatured SNase more than that of native SNase. We also showed that these two observations can be explained in terms of the thermal volume, which is related to the packing effect of solvent molecules.},

abstract = {A computer docking study has been carried out on the crystal surfaces of cellulose Ialpha crystal models for the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) protein of the cellobiohydrolase Cel7A produced by Trichoderma reesei. Binding free energy maps between the CBM and the crystal surface were obtained by calculating the noncovalent interactions and the solvation free energy at grid points covering the area of the unit cell dimensions at the crystal surface. The potential maps obtained from grid searches of the hydrophobic (110) crystal surface exhibited two distinct potential wells. These reflected the 2-fold helical symmetry of the cellulose chain and had lower binding energies at the minimum positions than those for the hydrophilic (100) and (010) crystal surfaces. The CBM-cellulose crystal complex models derived from the minimum positions were then subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation under an explicit solvent system. The (110) complex models exhibited larger affinities at the interface than the (100) and (010) ones. The CBM was more stably bound to the (110) surface when it was placed in an antiparallel orientation with respect to the cellulose fiber axis. In the solvated dynamics state, the curved (110) surface resulting from the fiber twist somewhat assisted a complementary fit with the CBM at the interface. In addition to the conventional Generalized Born (GB) method, the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory was adopted to assess a solvent effect for the solvated MD trajectories. Large exothermic values for the noncovalent interactions appeared correlated to and were mostly compensated by endothermic values for the solvation free energy. These gave total binding free energies of -13 to -28 kcal/mol. Results also suggested that the hydrogen bonding scheme was not essential for substrate specificity.},

The method is constructed by combining the quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods with the reference interaction site model (RISM) theory. The system treated with the method is divided into three regions, quantum and molecular mechanical regions of solute, and the solvent region. The two solute regions are treated by the ordinary QM/MM method, while the solvent region is handled with the RISM theory. The method is applied to investigate the intercalation of proflavine to two types of decameric B-DNA, namely [deca(dG-dC)]2and [deca(dA-dT)]2. Our results indicate that the affinity of intercalation of proflavine to the dG-dC base sequence is higher than that of the dA-dT DNA base sequence, which is consistent with the experimental results. The drastic change of solvation structure due to the intercalation makes large positive change in the solvation free energy which is attributed to the dehydration penalty of PR, the screening of electrostatic interaction between PR and DNA, and the hydrophobic interaction of elongated DNA chain. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We have developed an algorithm for sampling the conformational space of large flexible molecules in solution, which combines the molecular dynamics (MD) method and the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory. The solvent-induced force acting on solute atoms was evaluated as the gradient of the solvation free energy with respect to the solute-atom coordinates. To enhance the computation speed, we have applied a multiple timestep algorithm based on the RESPA (Reversible System Propagator Algorithm) to the combined MD/3D-RISM method. By virtue of the algorithm, one can choose a longer timestep for renewing the solvent-induced force compared with that of the conformational update. To illustrate the present MD/3D-RISM simulation, we applied the method to a model of acetylacetone in aqueous solution. The multiple timestep algorithm succeeded in enhancing the computation speed by 3.4 times for this model case. Acetylacetone possesses an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding capability between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen atom, and the molecule is significantly stabilized due to this hydrogen bond, especially in gas phase. The intramolecular hydrogen bond was kept intact during almost entire course of the MD simulation in gas phase, while in the aqueous solutions the bond is disrupted in a significant number of conformations. This result qualitatively agrees with the behavior on a free energy barrier lying upon the process for rotating a torsional degree of freedom of the hydroxyl group, where it is significantly reduced in aqueous solution by a cancellation between the electrostatic interaction and the solvation free energy.},

Previous applications of the method showed that it can predict relative free energies of solvation for small solutes accurately. However, the errors scale with the system size. In this study, we propose the use of the hard-sphere free energy as the reference and a linear response approximation to improve the performance, i.e., accuracy and robustness, of the method, particularly removing the size dependency of the error. The details of the new formalism are presented.

As for the PMF between solute atoms with like charges, the addition of increasing concentration of salt gradually leads from repulsive to attractive interactions. When the salt concentration becomes sufficiently high, the contact of like-charged atoms is stabilized and the stability is enhanced as the magnitude of the charge increases. For positive charges, the ability of salt to change the PMF is governed by anion species and becomes higher as the anionic size increases, while for neg- ative charges it is governed by cation species and becomes higher as the cationic size decreases. Concerning the PMF between solute atoms with unlike charges, the addition of increasing concentration of salt gradually leads from attractive to repulsive interactions. The contact of unlike-charged atoms is less stabilized than in pure water.

Calculations are performed over the range of temperatures and densities employing the SPC/E model for water and optimized site-site potentials for acetonitrile and methanol.

abstract = {An application of the coupled reference interaction site model (RISM)/simulation methodology to the calculation of the potential of mean force (PMF) curve in aqueous solution for the identity nucleophilic substitution reaction Cl- + CH3Cl is performed. The free energy of activation is calculated to be 27.1 kcal/mol which compares very well with the experimentally determined barrier height of 26.6 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the calculated PMF is almost superimposed with that previously calculated using the computationally rigorous Monte Carlo with importance sampling method (Chandrasekhar, J.; Smith, S. F.; Jorgensen, W. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 154). Using the calculated PMF, a crude estimate of the solvated kinetic transmission coefficient also compares well with that of previous more accurate simulations. These results indicate that the coupled RISM/simulation method provides a cost-effective methodology for studying reactions in solution.},

For the native structure of some proteins, the partial molar volume is decomposed into geometric and hydration contributions using the 3D-RISM theory combined with the geometric volume calculation. The hydration contributions are correlated with the surface properties of the protein. The thermal volume, which is the volume of voids around the protein induced by the thermal fluctuation of water molecules, is directly proportional to the accessible surface area of the protein. The interaction volume, which is the contribution of electrostatic interactions between the protein and water molecules, is apparently governed by the charged atomic groups on the protein surface. The polar atomic groups do not make any contribution to the interaction volume. The volume differences between low- and high-pressure structures of lysozyme are also analyzed by the present method.},

abstract = {The pressure effects on the molecular dynamics of liquid water are investigated using the site–site generalized Langevin modified mode-coupling theory. The calculations are performed for temperatures from 273 to 373 K and densities from 0.9 to 1.2 g/cm3. The static structure factor required as input is obtained from the reference interaction-site model hypernetted chain integral equation. The shear viscosity, the dielectric relaxation time, the translational diffusion coefficient, and the first-rank reorientational relaxation times are evaluated. All these quantities show unusual pressure dependence in the low-density, low-temperature region in that the molecular mobility is enhanced by applying the pressure. The magnitude of the enhancement is larger on the reorientational motions than on the translational ones. These tendencies are consistent with experimental observations, although the quantitative agreement is not so good. An analysis of the theory indicates that the decrease in the dielectricfriction on the collective polarization at small wave numbers upon increasing pressure is the principal reason for the pressure-induced enhancement of the dielectric relaxation and the decrease in the dielectric relaxation time affects other motions. The decrease in the dielectricfriction is caused by the decrease in the number-density fluctuation around the low-wave-number edge of the first peak of the structure factor by compression. The comparison between the results for water and acetonitrile extracts two characteristic features of water that are important for the anomalous pressure effect on its molecular motion. The first one is the small collisional friction on the reorientation due to the spherical repulsive core, and the second one is the strong short-range Coulombic interaction caused by the formation of the hydrogen bonding. A theoretical calculation on a model diatomic liquid consisting of oxygen and hydrogen atoms proposes that the above two characteristic properties of water are sufficient for the emergence of the anomalous pressure dependence. This conclusion is also supported by the molecular dynamics simulation performed on the same model diatomic liquid.},

The RISM-SCF model for aqueous urea gives a clearly nonplanar urea structure, with more than seven waters located within a contact distance defined for hydrogen bonding. The pyramidalization at the urea nitrogen sites is reduced in water relative to the gas phase, but the structure is closer to the gas phase structure than to the planar crystal structure. It is further shown that the solvent produces substantial polarization of the urea solute, with the dipole moment increasing from 4 to7Dasthe geometry and electronic structure are optimized to the aqueous environment. The overall result is to favor a high density of hydrogen bonds between urea and the surrounding solvent. The geometry obtained is intermediate between the previously known nonplanar gas phase structure and well-characterized planar crystal structure. An uncommon hemispherical shape for the electrostatic potential of around the carbonyl of urea is found, which affects the solvation structure.},

The radial distribution function is obtained as a special case. The theory is tested by examining the phase behavior of two fundamental complex fluids: the homopolymer blend and diblock copolymer melts. For the former it is found, contrary to HNC theory and its molecular generalizations, that a critical temperature Tc is predicted from the structure route. This To scales linearly with degree of polymerization N in agreement with Flory theory. The simplest form of the theory can be considered as a way to incorporate attractive interactions within a formalism that is very similar to that of the OZ or reference interaction site model (RISM).

The accuracy of calculations of the hydration free energy was tested using five equations available in the literature and five sets of parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential.

Discrimination is measured by comparison of site pair distributions for sites on identical molecules with the corresponding distributions for sites on mirror-image molecules. We find that discrimination is largest for distributions between the smallest sites in the molecules. Between racemates, those consisting of more asymmetrical chiral molecules (i.e., with a bigger range of site sizes and bond lengths) show the largest discrimination. The indirect correlation function is shown to be nondiscriminating in racemates. Further, exact relationships between like-like and like-unlike differences in the other pair functions have been obtained. From these, the importance of the bridge functions in discrimination is evident. The CSL theory always satisfies the exact relationships, even with approximate bridge diagrams. RISM theory cannot satisfy these exact limits regardless of density and closure relation. We have found that RISM theory predicts qualitatively incorrect pair distributions at low densities, but that the difference in the distributions is more accurate. All bridge diagrams which contribute to O(rho (o)) have been enumerated and evaluated. Inclusion of these diagrams into the CSL theory leads to exact results at low density. However, we find that the inclusion of the rho (o) diagrams has dramatically improved the quality of the CSL theory at all densities. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {It is experimentally known that alcohol induces peptides to form a-helix structures much more than water. Though the a-helix structure formed is independent of the alcohol species, degree of the induction increases as bulkiness of the hydrocarbon group in an alcohol molecule increases. In this article we investigate conformations of peptides (Met-enkephalin and the C-peptide fragment of ribonuclease A) in methanol, ethanol, and water using the reference interaction site model theory. Molecular models are employed fur the solvents. Our theoretical results show the following. Alcohol indeed facilitates peptide molecules to form the secondary structures with intramolecular hydrogen bonds such as the a-helix. In alcohol a solvophobic atom of a peptide is less solvophobic than in water while a solvophilic atom is less solvophilic. The solvation free energy in alcohol thus becomes considerably less variable against conformational changes than in water, with the result that the conformational stability in alcohol is governed by the conformational energy. The peptide molecule tends to take a conformation with the lowest conformational energy such as the a-helix, which is independent of the alcohol species. Moreover, these trends are enhanced as bulkiness of the hydrocarbon group in an alcohol molecule increases. In the text, the microscopic origin of the differences between alcohol and water in solvation of peptide molecules, which cannot be obtained by analyses treating the solvent as a dielectric continuum, is discussed in detail.},

The results for the equilibrium constant are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed endo/exo selectivity. The relative rate constants show that the endo reaction occurs preferentially in wide range of thermodynamic conditions. Difference of the solvation free energy shows that endo/exo selectivity is enlarged in ambient water by hydrophobic effect and that it disappears completely in supercritical water.

The theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The volume and compressibility values are decomposed into the volume-exclusion and electrostriction contributions. The volume-exclusion effect qualitatively determines the dependence of the partial molar volume on the ion size, whereas the electrostriction effect dominates in the size dependence of the partial molar compressibility. The partial molar volume and compressibility are further analyzed by using the hydration shell model which enables us to distinguish a contribution from each hydration shell. For the primary hydration shell, we can make contact with the classical models of ion hydration proposed by Frank-Wen and Samoilov. Water molecules in the immediate vicinity of an ion always give a negative contribution to its partial molar volume. The first hydration shell makes a negative contribution to the partial molar compressibility for the ions classified with the "positive hydration" in terms of Samoilov's model and does the opposite contribution for those with the "negative hydration". The reason the water structure around a negatively hydrated ion is more compressible is explained in terms of density fluctuations around the ions from a viewpoint of the Landau fluctuation formula for the thermodynamic response functions.},

Acetonitrile (CH3CN) and water (H2O) were selected as polar solvents. We obtain both the optimized solute geometry in solution and the total free energy profile with respect to variation in the torsion angle between the pyridinium and phenoxide rings and analyze the various electronic and solvation contributions. The betaine molecule in the gas phase has a twisted geometry, which is slightly more twisted in solution. In acetonitrile, the calculated structure shows good agreement with earlier semiempirical results for the minimum free energy structure. It is shown that the solute dipole moment is strongly enhanced in polar solution, also in accord with earlier semiempirical calculations. However, in solution, there is relatively little change in dipole moment with changes in the torsion angle, in contrast to the marked variation in the gas phase. Correspondingly, the solvation free energy is only weakly more negative with increasing twist. Electron correlation in the solute molecule is shown to play an important role in the torsional free energy, destabilizing the twisted form. This destabilization decreases by a factor of 4 from the gas phase to water, with increasing charge localization induced by the solvent. The implications of these results for interaction site models of charge-separated conjugated molecules in solution are discussed.},

This study also shows that the performance of the force fields in describing H-bond strength can be validated by AF-QM/MM calculated imino proton chemical shifts. The polarized nucleic acid-specific charge (PNC) model significantly improves the accuracy of imino hydrogen and nitrogen NMR chemical shift prediction as compared to the FF10 force field, which underscores that the electrostatic polarization effect is critical to stabilizing the hydrogen bonds between base pairs in RNAs. Furthermore, the accuracy of the chemical shift of amino proton can be improved by adding explicit water molecules.},

Studies of the temperature dependence of these values (i.e. solvation enthalpies and entropies) can provide additional insights into the performance of implicit solvent models. Here, we show how to compute temperature derivatives of hydration free energies for the 3D-RISM integral equation approach.

Temperature derivatives were also used to calculate hydration energies and entropies of 74 of these molecules (both neutral and charged) for which experimental data is available.

To improve the free-energy density functional for the SFE of solute molecules, we propose a reference-modified density functional theory (RMDFT) that is a general theoretical approach to construct the free-energy density functional systematically. In the RMDFT formulation, hard-sphere (HS) fluids are introduced as the reference system instead of an ideal polyatomic molecular gas, which has been regarded as the appropriate reference system of the interaction-site-model density functional theory for polyatomic molecular fluids.

abstract = {We develop a predictive model to study how flocculant additives alter the interactions among clay particles in colloidal suspensions, such as industrial mining tailings. Fully atomistic models of kaolinite nanoplatelets constructed from X-ray crystal structure data feature a highly polarized charge distribution, which defines their solvation, adsorption, and association properties. Effective interactions, in the form of potential of mean force (PMF), between kaolinite platelets in aqueous electrolyte solution are calculated using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko Hirata closure relation (3D-RISM-KH) molecular theory of solvation based on the first-principles of statistical mechanics. This theory is also employed to study the adsorption of ions and flocculant additive building blocks onto kaolinite surfaces. Three main mutual orientations of platelets are studied in aqueous electrolyte solutions of several polymer building blocks represented by acrylamide, acrylic acid, acrylate, and styrene. The results indicate that Na+ are predominantly adsorbed onto the siloxane surface of kaolinite while the chloride and acrylate anions prefer the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite. Weaker adsorption preference is observed for the neutral monomers. The PMF between platelets depends nontrivially on the concentration of solvent components and exhibits a complex oscillating behavior with several minima and maxima that correspond to important solvation and aggregation energy barriers. Among the three studied mutual orientations of the nanoplatelets, the most stable one corresponds to the direct contact of the aluminum hydroxide with siloxane surfaces. Other highly probable arrangements correspond to nanoplatelets separated by a single layer of solvent. The effect of additives on interparticle interactions is correlated with the strength of adsorption on kaolinite relative to water, as strongly and weakly adsorbing species cause increase and decrease, respectively, of the PMF at short distances.

abstract = {The effect of charge hydration asymmetry (CHA)—non-invariance of solvation free energy upon solute charge inversion—is missing from the standard linear response continuum electrostatics. The proposed charge hydration asymmetric–generalized Born (CHA–GB) approximation introduces this effect into the popular generalized Born (GB) model. The CHA is added to the GB equation via an analytical correction that quantifies the specific propensity of CHA of a given water model; the latter is determined by the charge distribution within the water model. Significant variations in CHA seen in explicit water (TIP3P, TIP4P-Ew, and TIP5P-E) free energy calculations on charge-inverted “molecular bracelets” are closely reproduced by CHA–GB, with the accuracy similar to models such as SEA and 3D-RISM that go beyond the linear response. Compared against reference explicit (TIP3P) electrostatic solvation free energies, CHA–GB shows about a 40{\%} improvement in accuracy over the canonical GB, tested on a diverse set of 248 rigid small neutral molecules (root mean square error, rmse = 0.88 kcal/mol for CHA–GB vs 1.24 kcal/mol for GB) and 48 conformations of amino acid analogs (rmse = 0.81 kcal/mol vs 1.26 kcal/mol). CHA–GB employs a novel definition of the dielectric boundary that does not subsume the CHA effects into the intrinsic atomic radii. The strategy leads to finding a new set of intrinsic atomic radii optimized for CHA–GB; these radii show physically meaningful variation with the atom type, in contrast to the radii set optimized for GB. Compared to several popular radii sets used with the original GB model, the new radii set shows better transferability between different classes of molecules.},

Its generalization to solutions sorbed in disordered nanoporous materials using the replica method for statistical mechanics of quenched-annealed systems, replica RISM-KH-VM theory, provides full microscopic details of the solvation structure and thermodynamics as well as the electrochemical properties averaged over the thermal motion of sorbed solution and over quenched morphology of host nanoporous material. The replica RISM-KH-VM theory reveals the molecular mechanisms and driving forces of sorption of electrolyte solution in a nanoporous carbon electrode which are drastically different from the electrical double layer in electrolyte solution at a planar electrode. These include nanoporous confinement morphology and external charge, size and chemical specificities of solvent and electrolyte, osmotic forces, the internal EDL at the surface of nanopores and the external EDL at the contact with bulk solution. The interplay of these factors determines the efficiency of an electrosorption cell and the specific capacitance of the electrochemical supercapacitor. {\textcopyright}The Electrochemical Society.},

A comparison with the PBSA and GBSA continuum solvation models was performed to identify the approach in the best agreement with experimental results for the binding free energy. Compared to the PBSA or GBSA methods, the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation provides a more accurate description of the nonpolar contribution to the solvation free energy from the first principles of statistical mechanics. The binding free energy was calculated by using separate trajectories for the DNA complex and its two strands, as well as based on a single trajectory for the complex, both with and without account for explicit counter ions in post-processing of molecular dynamics trajectories to calculate the binding free energy of oligonucleotides. Overall, both GBSA and 3D-RISM-KH predict the binding free energy obtained from "separate trajectory" calculations with implicit account for counter ions in a good agreement with experiment, the latter showing a better performance for larger oligonucleotides.},

abstract = {We have proposed a new canonical–isokinetic ensemble for efficient sampling of conformational space in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which leads to the optimised isokinetic Nos{\'{e}}–Hoover (OIN) chain algorithm for atomic and molecular systems. We applied OIN to multiple time step (MTS) MD simulations of the rigid and flexible models of water to demonstrate its advantage over the standard canonical, isokinetic and canonical–isokinetic ensembles. With the stabilising effect of OIN thermostatting in MTS-MD, gigantic outer time steps up to picoseconds can be employed to accurately calculate equilibrium and conformational properties. Furthermore, we developed the atomic version of OIN for MTS-MD of a biomolecule in a solvent potential of mean force obtained at sequential MD steps by using the molecular theory of solvation, aka three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko–Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). The solvation forces are obtained analytically by converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations once per several OIN outer time steps, and are calculated in between by using solvation force-coordinate extrapolation (SFCE) in the subspace of previous successive solutions to 3D-RISM-KH. For illustration, we applied the multiscale OIN/SFCE/3D-RISM-KH algorithm to a fully flexible model of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution. Although the computational rate of solvent sampling in OIN/SFCE/3D-RISM-KH is already 20 times faster than standard MD with explicit solvent, further substantial acceleration of sampling stems from making solute evolution steps in a statistically averaged potential of mean force obtained from 3D-RISM-KH. The latter efficiently samples the phase space for essential events with rare statistics such as exchange and localisation of solvent and ligand molecules in confined spaces, pockets and at binding sites of the solute macromolecule, as distinct from MD with explicit solvent which requires enormous computational time and number of steps in such cases.},

abstract = {A classical density functional theory approach to solvation in molecular solvent is presented. The solvation properties of an arbitrary solute in a given solvent, both described by a molecular force field, can be obtained by minimization of a position and orientation-dependent free-energy density functional. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, limited to two-body correlations, the unknown excess term of the functional approximated by the angular-dependent direct correlation function of the pure solvent. We show that this function can be extracted from a preliminary MD simulation of the pure solvent by computing the angular-dependent pair distribution function and solving subsequently the molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation using a discrete angular representation. The corresponding functional can then be minimized in the presence of an arbitrary solute on a three-dimensional cubic grid for positions and Gauss-Legendre angular grid for orientations to provide the solvation structure and free-energy. This two-step procedure is proved to be much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined to thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be relevant and accurate for prototype polar solvents such as the Stockmayer solvent or acetonitrile. For water, although correct for neutral or moderately charged solute, it tends to underestimate the tetrahedral solvation structure around H-bonded solutes, such as spherical ions. This can be corrected by introducing suitable three-body correlation terms that restore both an accurate hydration structure and a satisfactory energetics.},

abstract = {Nonpolar solute-solvent interactions are the driving force for aggregation in important chemical and biological phenomena including protein folding, peptide self-assembly, and oil-water emulsion formation. Currently, the most accurate and computationally efficient description of these processes requires an explicit treatment of all solvent and solute atoms. Previous computationally feasible implicit solvent models, such as solute surface area approaches, are unsuccessful at capturing aggregation features including both structural and energetic trends while more theoretically rigorous approaches, such as Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM), are accurate but extremely computationally demanding. Our approach, denoted Implicit Solvation using the Superposition Approximation (IS-SPA), builds on previous theory utilizing the Kirkwood superposition approximation to approximate the mean force of the solvent from solute parameters. We introduce and verify a parabolic first solvation shell truncation of atomic solvation; fitting water distributions around a molecule, and a Monte Carlo integration of the mean solvent force. These extensions allow this method to be implemented as an efficient nonpolar implicit solvent model for molecular simulation. The approximations in IS-SPA are first explored and justified for the homodimerization of an array of different sized Lennard-Jones spheres. The accuracy and transferability of the approach are demonstrated by its ability to capture the position and relative energies of the desolvation barrier and free energy minimum of alkane homodimers. The model is then shown to reproduce the phase separation and solubility of cyclohexane and water. These promising results, coupled with 2 orders of magnitude speed-up for dilute systems as compared to explicit solvent simulations, demonstrate that IS-SPA is an appealing approach to boost the time- and length-scale of molecular aggregation simulations.},

abstract = {Here, we discuss a new method for predicting the hydration free energy (HFE) of organic pollutants and illustrate the eﬃciency of the method on a set of 220 chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. The new model is computationally inexpensive, with one HFE calculation taking less than a minute on a PC. The method is based on a combination of a molecular integral equations theory, one-dimensional reference interaction site model (1D RISM), with the cheminformatics approach. We correct HFEs obtained by the 1D RISM with a set of empirical corrections. The corrections are associated with the partial molar volume and structural descriptors of the molecules. We show that the introduced corrections can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of the 1D RISM HFE predictions obtained by the partial wave free energy expression [Ten-no, S. J. Chem. Phys. 2001, 115, 3724] and the KovalenkoHirata closure [Kovalenko, A.; Hirata, F. J. Chem. Phys. 1999, 110, 10095]. We also show that the quality of the model can be further improved by the reparametrization using QM-derived partial charges instead of the originally used OPLS-AA partial charges. The ﬁnal model gives good results for polychlorinated benzenes (the mean and standard deviation of the error are 0.02 and 0.36 kcal/mol, correspondingly). At the same time, the model gives somewhat worse results for polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) with a systematic bias of 0.72 kcal/mol but a small standard deviation equal to 0.55 kcal/mol. We note that the error remains the same for the whole set of PCBs, whereas errors of HFEs predicted with continuum solvation models (data were taken from Phillips, K. L. et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42, 8412) increase signiﬁcantly for higher chlorinated PCB congeners. In conclusion, we discuss potential future applications of the model and several avenues for its further improvement.},

As one of the bridge correction methods to improve the precision of these thermodynamic quantities, it was shown in our previous paper that the method to apparently adjust sigma parameter in the LJ potential is effective [T.

In our previous paper, we evaluated the actual variation in the sigma parameter by using a fitting procedure to molecular dynamics (MD) results. In this article, we propose an alternative method to determine the actual variation in the sigma parameter. The proposed method utilizes a condition that the virial and compressibility pressures coincide with each other. This method can correct OZ theory without a fitting procedure to MD results, and possesses characteristics of keeping a form of HNC and/or KH closure. We calculate the radial distribution function, pressure, excess internal energy, and excess chemical potential for one-component LJ fluids to check the performance of our proposed bridge function.

Results are compared to explicit molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using the same force fields, and to experiment. The mean activity coefficients of ions predicted by DRISM agree well with experimental values at concentrations below 0.5 m, especially when using the HNC closure. As individual ion activities (and the corresponding solvation free energies) are not known from experiment, only DRISM and MD results are directly compared and found to have reasonably good agreement. The activity of water directly estimated from DRISM is nearly consistent with values derived from the DRISM ion activities and the Gibbs-Duhem equation, but the changes in the computed pressure as a function of salt concentration dominate these comparisons. Good agreement with experiment is obtained if these pressure changes are ignored. Radial distribution functions of NaCl solution at three concentrations were compared between DRISM and MD simulations. DRISM shows comparable water distribution around the cation, but water structures around the anion deviate from the MD results; this may also be related to the high pressure of the system. Despite some problems, DRISM-PSE-n is an effective tool for investigating thermodynamic properties of simple electrolytes.},

The $\pi$-$\pi$* excitation energies are computed for BM and its derivative 2,6-di-tert-butyl (di-t-Bu) BM. The behaviors of the computed excitation energies with increasing solvent polarity are in good agreement with those of the corresponding experimental measurements. In addition, analysis of the solute-solvent interaction energies and spatial distribution functions reveals that the effects of the solvent on the absorption spectra are reduced by the steric hindrance of the t-Bu groups. Furthermore, from the difference in the solute-solvent interaction energies of BM and di-t-Bu BM, it is shown that the effect of the t-Bu substituents on the absorption spectrum is greater in high-polarity solvents.},

abstract = {Accurate force fields are one of the major pillars on which successful molecular dynamics simulations of complex biomolecular processes rest. They have been optimized for ambient conditions, whereas high-pressure simulations become increasingly important in pressure perturbation studies, using pressure as an independent thermodynamic variable. Here, we explore the design of non-polarizable force fields tailored to work well in the realm of kilobar pressures – while avoiding complete reparameterization. Our key is to first compute the pressure-induced electronic and structural response of a solute by combining an integral equation approach to include pressure effects on solvent structure with a quantum-chemical treatment of the solute within the embedded cluster reference interaction site model (EC-RISM) framework. Next, the solute's response to compression is taken into account by introducing pressure-dependence into selected parameters of a well-established force field. In our proof-of-principle study, the full machinery is applied to N,N,N-trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in water being a potent osmolyte that counteracts pressure denaturation. EC-RISM theory is shown to describe well the charge redistribution upon compression of TMAO(aq) to 10 kbar, which is then embodied in force field molecular dynamics by pressure-dependent partial charges. The performance of the high pressure force field is assessed by comparing to experimental and ab initio molecular dynamics data. Beyond its broad usefulness for designing non-polarizable force fields for extreme thermodynamic conditions, a good description of the pressure-response of solutions is highly recommended when constructing and validating polarizable force fields},

We have employed the hypernetted chain (HNC), Kovalenko-Hirata (KH), Kobryn-Gusarov-Kovalenko (KGK), and Percus-Yevick (PY) closure equations. Further, we have extended the Verlet-modified (VM) closure to the two-component system to examine the accuracy of this method in terms of the SFE. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to compare the results with the above mentioned OZ theories. The HNC and KH approximations significantly overestimate the SFE, whereas the PY approximation tends to underestimate it. The overestimation of the SFE by the KGK approximation becomes significant when the solvent density is relatively high. In contrast, the VM approximation is found to be rather accurate at all studied conditions. An analysis of the integrand for the SFE reveals that, to improve the SFE, the first rising (FR) region in the radial distribution function (RDF) must be corrected. We have also tested the sigma-enlarging-bridge (SEB) function that we proposed previously [T. Miyata and Y. Ebato, J. Mol. Liq. 217 (2016) 75] for the correction of the FR region of the RDF. In this study, we applied the SEB function to both HNC-type and KH-type closures and found that these combinations (SEB-HNC and SEB-KH) improve the SFE significantly.},

abstract = {We report an implementation of the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D RISM) that in particular addresses the treatment of the long-range Coulomb field of charged species, represented by point charges and/or a distributed charge density. A comparison of 1D and 3D results for atomic ions demonstrates a reasonable accuracy, even for a moderate size of the unit cell and a moderate grid resolution. In an application to uranyl complexes with 4-6 explicit aqua ligands and an implicit bulk solvent modeled by RISM, we show that the 3D technique is not susceptible to the deficiencies of the 1D technique exposed in our previous work [Li, Matveev, Kr{\"{u}}ger, R{\"{o}}sch, Comp. Theor. Chem. 2015, 1051, 151]. The 3D method eliminates the artificial superposition of explicit aqua ligands and the RISM medium and predicts essentially the same values for uranyl and uranyl-water bond lengths as a state-of-the-art polarizable continuum model. With the first solvation shell treated explicitly, the observables are nearly independent of the order of the closure relationship used when solving the set of integral equations for the various distribution functions. Furthermore, we calculated the activation barrier of water exchange with a hybrid approach that combines the 3D RISM model for the bulk aqueous solvent and a quantum mechanical description (at the level of electronic density functional theory) of uranyl interacting with explicitly represented water molecules. The calculated result agrees very well with experiment and the best theoretical estimates.},

We also investigated the main structural biological factor using spatial decomposition analysis in which the solvation free energy values are decomposed into the residue. We found some characteristic residues that contribute to stabilization of the holo-structure (Ca2+-binding structure). These results indicated that, in the holo-structure, these residues are newly exposed to solvent.

The influence of the Cl-and SO42- was found to be nonspecific and insignificant. On the contrary, Br-and H2PO4- ions can considerably affect the inclusion complex formation. Insertion of Br-into the macrocyclic cavity and attraction between H2PO4- and the zwitterions are the main processes competing with cyclodextrin-acid binding.

abstract = {Although three-dimensional site-site molecular integral equations of liquids are a powerful tool of the modern theoretical chemistry, their applications to the problem of characterizing the electrical double layer originating at the solid-liquid interface with a macroscopic substrate are severely limited by the fact that an infinitely extended charged plane generates a divergent electrostatic potential. Such potentials cannot be treated within the standard 3D-Reference Interaction Site Model equation solution framework since it leads to functions that are not Fourier transformable. In this paper, we apply a renormalization procedure to overcome this obstacle. We then check the validity and numerical accuracy of the proposed computational scheme on the prototypical gold (111) surface in contact with water/alkali chloride solution. We observe that despite the proposed method requires, to achieve converged charge densities, a higher spatial resolution than that suited to the estimation of biomolecular solvation with either 3D-RISM or continuum electrostatics approaches, it still is computationally efficient. Introducing the electrostatic potential of an infinite wall, which is periodic in 2 dimensions, we avoid edge effects, permit a robust integration of Poisson's equation, and obtain the 3D electrostatic potential profile for the first time in such calculations. We show that the potential within the electrical double layer presents oscillations which are not grasped by the Debye-Huckel and Gouy-Chapman theories. This electrostatic potential deviates from its average of up to 1-2 V at small distances from the substrate along the lateral directions. Applications of this theoretical development are relevant, for example, for liquid scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. Published by AIP Publishing.},

abstract = {The effect of solute concentration/pressure on the TMAO hydration structure was studied to understand its protective action under abiotic stressors. Despite the well-known fact that the natural osmolyte trimethylamine- N -oxide (TMAO) is able to prevent protein denaturation and to stabilize the folded state of proteins in living cells under abiotic stress, much of its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. At the moment, there is some evidence that osmolytes, including TMAO, do not interact with proteins directly but only through a water layer. It is supposed that their protective mechanism should be mediated and determined largely by their hydration, i.e. by osmolyte interactions with surrounding water. However, to date the details of these interactions are far from being fully understood. To gain further insight into the mechanism behind the protecting effect of osmolytes statistical mechanics calculations in the framework of 1D- and 3D-RISM (reference interaction site model) approaches were performed to yield information on the impact of solute concentration and pressure on the hydration structure of TMAO. An attempt was made to link the structural features of TMAO hydration to its biological role. },

Molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann (generalized Born) surface area [MM/PB(GB)SA] post-processing of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories involving SA empirical nonpolar terms is replaced with MM/3D-RISM-KH statistical–mechanical evaluation of the solvation thermodynamics. 3D-RISM-KH has been coupled with multiple time-step (MTS) MD of the solute biomolecule driven by effective solvation forces, which are obtained analytically by converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations at outer time-steps and are calculated in between by using solvation force coordinate extrapolation (SFCE) in the subspace of previous solutions to 3D-RISM-KH. The procedure is stabilized by the optimized isokinetic Nos{\'{e}}–Hoover (OIN) chain thermostatting, which enables gigantic outer time-steps up to picoseconds to accurately calculate equilibrium properties. The multiscale OIN/SFCE/3D-RISM-KH algorithm is implemented in the Amber package and illustrated on a fully flexible model of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution, exhibiting the computational rate of solvent sampling 20 times faster than standard MD with explicit solvent. Further substantial acceleration can be achieved with 3D-RISM-KH efficiently sampling essential events with rare statistics such as exchange and localization of solvent, ions, and ligands at binding sites and pockets of the biomolecule. 3D-RISM-KH was coupled with ab initio complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and orbital-free embedding (OFE) Kohn–Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemistry methods in an SCF description of electronic structure, optimized geometry, and chemical reactions in solution. The (OFE)KS-DFT/3D-RISM-KH multi-scale method is implemented in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package and extensively validated against experiment for solvation thermochemistry, photochemistry, conformational equilibria, and activation barriers of various nanosystems in solvents and ionic liquids (ILs). Finally, the replica RISM-KH-VM molecular theory for the solvation structure, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry of electrolyte solutions sorbed in nanoporous materials reveals the molecular mechanisms of sorption and supercapacitance in nanoporous carbon electrodes, which is drastically different from a planar electrical double layer. },

abstract = {We applied a multiscale modeling approach that involves the statistical–mechanical three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko–Hirata closure approximation (3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation) as well as density functional theory (DFT) of electronic structure to study the role of water in aggregation of the asphaltene model compound 4,4′-bis(2-pyren-1-yl-ethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (PBP) [X. Tan, H. Fenniri and M. R. Gray, Energy Fuels, 2008, 22, 715]. The solvation free energy and potential of mean force predicted by 3D-RISM-KH reveal favorable pathways for disaggregation of PBP dimers in pure versuswater-saturated chloroform solvent. The water density distribution functions elucidate hydrogen bonding preferences and water bridge formation between PBP monomers. The $\Delta$G298 values of −5 to −7 kcal mol−1 for transfer of water molecules in chloroform to a state interacting with PBP molecules are in agreement with experimental results. Geometry optimization and thermochemistry analysis of PBP dimers with and without water bridges using WB97Xd/6-31G(d,p) predict that both PBP dimerization and dimer stabilization by water bridges are spontaneous ($\Delta$G298 {\textless} 0). The 1H NMR chemical shifts of PBP monomers and dimers predicted using the gauge-independent atomic orbital method and polarizable continuum model for solvation in chloroform are in an excellent agreement with the experimental results for dilute and concentrated PBP solutions in chloroform, respectively [X. Tan, H. Fenniri and M. R. Gray, Energy Fuels, 2009, 23, 3687]. The DFT calculations of PBP dimers with explicit water show that bridges containing 1–3 water molecules lead to stabilization of PBP dimers. Additional water molecules form hydrogen bonds with these bridges and de-shield the PBP protons, negating the effect of water on the 1HC3 NMR chemical shift of PBP, in agreement with experiment. The $\Delta$G298 results show that hydrogen bonding to water and water-promoted polynuclear assembly bridging is as important as $\pi$–$\pi$ interactions for asphaltene aggregation.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition interactions between kaolinite and a series of heterocyclic aromatic compounds (HAC) representative of the N- and S-containing moieties in petroleum asphaltene macromolecules are investigated using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure approximation (3D-RISM-KH) theory of solvation and experimental techniques in toluene solvent. The statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation predicts the adsorption configuration and thermodynamics from the 3D site density distribution functions and total solvation free energy, respectively, for adsorption of HAC and toluene on kaolinite. Spectrophotometric measurements show that, among the HAC studied, only acridine and phenanthridine adsorb quantitatively on kaolinite. For these pyridinic HAC, the adsorption results fitted to the Langmuir isotherm in the monolayer domain suggest a uniform monolayer of HAC molecules. The 3D-RISM-KH studies predict that the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite is preferred for HAC adsorption due to strong hydrogen bonding with the pyridinic N atoms, while the rest of the HAC adsorb weaker. Adsorption on the silicon oxide side is weak and delocalized, as evident from the 3D solvation free energy density. Toluene sites effectively compete with non-hydrogen bonding HAC, such as fused thiophenes, for the kaolinite surface. The adsorption enthalpy and phenanthridine-acridine loading ratio are calculated and correlated with the experimentally determined Langmuir constant and adsorption loading. This combined experimental and computational modeling approach is aimed to provide insight into the specific interactions among clays, bitumen, and solvents so as to help accelerate the development of environmentally friendly and efficient desorption systems for nonaqueous extraction of bitumen from Oil Sands, an important unconventional petroleum reserve.},

abstract = {The geometry of phenanthridine, benzothiophene, tetralin, and naphthalene representative of the heterocyclic, naphthenic, and aromatic components of bitumen adsorbed on kaolinite is optimized using density functional theory and periodic boundary conditions in gas phase. These bitumen model compounds preferentially adsorb on the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite with energy decreasing in the order phenanthridine {\textgreater} naphthalene {\textgreater} tetralin similar to benzothiophene. The adsorption of phenanthridine is strengthened by hydrogen bonding between the pyridinic N atom and an axial hydroxyl group of kaolinite, while the rest of the molecules adsorb through van der Waals interactions. The mechanism of solvation in CO2 and the effect of liquid and supercritical CO2 on the adsorption thermodynamics are studied using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model theory with the closure approximation of Kovalenko and Hirata (3D-RISM-KH) molecular theory of solvation at 293-333 K and 10-30 MPa. The CO2 solvent interacts with the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite by hydrogen bonding, with the pyridinic N atom of phenanthridine by electrostatic interactions, and with the rest of the bitumen model compounds by hydrophobic interactions, as inferred from the 3D site density distribution functions of CO2. The molecule-kaolinite potentials of mean force in CO2 show that the adsorption of naphthalene and tetralin on kaolinite is substantially weakened as the pressure is increased and the temperature is decreased. Benzothiophene adsorption is the least sensitive to CO2 temperature and pressure changes. In liquid CO2 at 30 MPa and 293 K, the hydrocarbon molecules are weakly adsorbed and can be desorbed by CO2, while the heterocycles would remain adsorbed, suggesting an approach for extraction of deasphalted bitumen from oil sands. While the most favorable thermodynamic conditions for desorption are in liquid CO2, the kinetic barrier for desorption is the most sensitive to small changes in the temperature and pressure in supercritical CO2, indicating that supercritical conditions are important for desorption rate control. These results suggest that the investigated bitumen components can be selectively desorbed from kaolinite by controlling the temperature and pressure of the CO2 solvent and agree with experimental reports on heavy oil recovery. These insights are valuable for the development of improved techniques for extraction of bitumen from oil sands and deasphalting of bitumen using liquid and supercritical CO2.},

In particular, the closure equation for 3D-RISM is integrated with the bridge functions derived from minimizing the hard-sphere free-energy functional for different interactions. The density distributions of water molecules around different solute molecules are calculated to intuitively describe the solvent effects. The solution enthalpies and hydration free-energies are then determined by the density distributions. Meanwhile, the solution enthalpies for some alkanolamines with low volatility are measured, and the values at infinite dilution are thereby obtained through extrapolation. It is shown that the theoretical predictions are generally in agreement with the experimental results, suggesting that the current theoretical approach is reasonable to quantitatively evaluate the solvent effect of various amine-based CO2 absorbents.},

abstract = {Understanding the polymorphic states of metal amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) interactions helps to elucidate metal-mediated events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Systematic investigations on the effects of metal ions such as Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) on the structural and thermodynamic properties of A$\beta$ at the molecular lever seem desirable. In this study, a set of new AMBER force field parameters was developed to model various Cu(2+) coordination spheres of A$\beta$. These parameters including force constants and partial charges obtained using restrained electrostatic potential method were then validated in replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations on six Cu(2+)-A$\beta$(1-16) systems. The Cu(2+) coordination geometry differs depending on the Cu(2+) binding fashions. The structural analyses reveal that A$\beta$(1-16) prefers turn conformations, which provides a geometrical favor to establish multiple Cu(2+) coordination modes in solution at physiological pH. The relative stability of different Cu(2+)-A$\beta$(1-16) complexes was estimated by free energy calculations. The Cu(2+) ligands in the most stable Cu(2+)-A$\beta$(1-16) structure involve Glu(3) , His(6) , His(13) and His(14) in terms of MM/3D-RISM (molecular mechanics/three-dimensional reference interaction site model). The solvation free energy and conformational entropy calculated by 3D-RISM method suggest that the binding of Cu(2+) within A$\beta$(1-16) is a spontaneous process. The overlap of the preparation free energy distributions demonstrates the heterogeneous states of A$\beta$(1-16) conformations that are ready for Cu(2+) binding whereas the populations of such polymorphic states may shift at differing pH.},

Experiments have shown that diffusion of polyatomic ions exhibits many remarkable anomalies; notable among them is the fact that polyatomic ions with similar size show large difference in their diffusivity values. This fact has drawn relatively little interest in scientific discussions. We show here that a mode-coupling theory can provide a physically meaningful interpretation of the anomalous diffusivity of polyatomic ions in water, by including the contribution of rotational jumps on translational friction. The two systems discussed here, namely, aqueous nitrate ion and aqueous acetate ion, although have similar ionic radii, exhibit largely different diffusivity values due to the differences in the rate of their rotational jump motions. We have further verified the mode-coupling theory formalism by comparing it with experimental and simulation results that agree well with the theoretical prediction. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Transitions discussed are sensitive to the value of direct correlation functions of the effective liquid which is required as an input information in the theory. Accurate evaluation of pair correlation functions is emphasized. Calculation of these correlation functions which pose problems in the case of ordered phases is discussed. The pair correlation functions of the ordered phase, which are supposed to be made up of two contributions, one that preserves the symmetry of the isotropic phase and a second that breaks it, are discussed.

abstract = {The molecular origin of the energy produced by the ATP hydrolysis has been one of the long-standing fundamental issues. A classical view is that the negative hydrolysis free energy of ATP originates from intramolecular effects connected with the backbone P?O bond, so called ?high-energy bond?. On the other hand, it has also been recognized that solvation effects are essential in determining the hydrolysis free energy. Here, using the 3D-RISM-SCF (three-dimensional reference interaction site model self-consistent field) theory that integrates the ab initio quantum chemistry method and the statistical mechanical theory of liquids, we investigate the molecular origin of hydrolysis free energy of pyrophosphate, an ATP analogue, in water. We demonstrate that our theory quantitatively reproduces the experimental results without the use of empirical parameters. We clarify the crucial role of water in converting the hydrolysis free energy in the gas phase determined solely by intramolecular effects, which ranges from endothermic, thermoneutral, to highly exothermic depending on the charged state of pyrophosphate, into moderately exothermic in the aqueous phase irrespective of the charged state as observed in experimental data. We elucidate that this is brought about by different natures of solute?water interactions depending on the charged state of solute species: the hydration free energy of low-charged state is mainly subjected to short-range hydrogen-bonds, while that of high-charged state is dominated by long-range electrostatic interactions. We thus provide unambiguous evidence on the critical role of water in determining the ATP hydrolysis free energy.},

As for the structure, comparison with Monte Carlo shows that molecular closures are slightly more predictive than their 'atomic' counterparts, and thermodynamic properties are equally accurate. We also devise an application of molecular closures to models interacting via continuous, soft-core potentials, by using well established prescriptions in liquid state perturbation theories. In the case of Lennard-Jones dimers, our scheme definitely improves over the atomic one, providing semi-quantitative structural results, and quite good estimates of internal energy, pressure and phase coexistence.

abstract = {Cellulose Nanocrysals (CNC) is a renewable biodegradable biopolymer with outstanding mechanical properties made from highly abundant natural source, and therefore is very attractive as reinforcing additive to replace petroleum-based plastics in biocomposite materials, foams, and gels. Large-scale applications of CNC are currently limited due to its low solubility in non-polar organic solvents used in existing polymerization technologies. The solvation properties of CNC can be improved by chemical modification of its surface. Development of effective surface modifications has been rather slow because extensive chemical modifications destabilize the hydrogen bonding network of cellulose and deteriorate the mechanical properties of CNC. We employ predictive multiscale theory, modeling, and simulation to gain a fundamental insight into the effect of CNC surface modifications on hydrogen bonding, CNC crystallinity, solvation thermodynamics, and CNC compatibilization with the existing polymerization technologies, so as to rationally design green nanomaterials with improved solubility in non-polar solvents, controlled liquid crystal ordering and optimized extrusion properties. An essential part of this multiscale modeling approach is the statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation, coupled with quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, and multistep molecular dynamics simulation. The 3D-RISM-KH theory provides predictive modeling of both polar and non-polar solvents, solvent mixtures, and electrolyte solutions in a wide range of concentrations and thermodynamic states. It properly accounts for effective interactions in solution such as steric effects, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, hydrogen bonding, salt bridges, buffer, co-solvent, and successfully predicts solvation effects and processes in bulk liquids, solvation layers at solid surface, and in pockets and other inner spaces of macromolecules and supramolecular assemblies. This methodology enables rational design of CNC-based bionanocomposite materials and systems. Furthermore, the 3D-RISM-KH based multiscale modeling addresses the effect of hemicellulose and lignin composition on nanoscale forces that control cell wall strength towards overcoming plant biomass recalcitrance. It reveals molecular forces maintaining the cell wall structure and provides directions for genetic modulation of plants and pretreatment design to render biomass more amenable to processing. We envision integrated biomass valorization based on extracting and decomposing the non-cellulosic components to low molecular weight chemicals and utilizing the cellulose microfibrils to make CNC. This is an important alternative to approaches of full conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels that face challenges arising from the deleterious impact of cellulose crystallinity on enzymatic processing.},

Two cell-surface receptors for ISM have been defined, the high-affinity glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) and the low-affinity $\alpha$v$\beta$5 integrin. As $\alpha$v$\beta$5 integrin plays an important role in pulmonary vascular permeability (VP) and ISM is highly expressed in mouse lung, we sought to clarify the role of ISM in VP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Recombinant ISM (rISM) dose-dependently enhances endothelial monolayer permeability in vitro and local dermal VP when administered intradermally in mice. Systemic rISM administration through intravenous injection leads to profound lung vascular hyperpermeability but not in other organs. Mechanistic investigations using molecular, biochemical approaches and specific chemical inhibitors revealed that ISM-GRP78 interaction triggers a direct interaction between GRP78 and Src, leading to Src activation and subsequent phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins and loss of junctional proteins from inter-endothelial junctions, resulting in enhanced VP. Dynamic studies of Src activation, VP and apoptosis revealed that ISM induces VP directly via Src activation while apoptosis contributes indirectly only after prolonged treatment. Furthermore, ISM is significantly up-regulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse lung. Blocking cell-surface GRP78 by systemic infusion of anti-GRP78 antibody significantly attenuates pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability in LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: ISM is a novel VP inducer that functions through cell-surface GRP78-mediated Src activation as well as induction of apoptosis. It induces a direct GRP78-Src interaction, leading to cytoplasmic Src activation. ISM contributes to pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability of LPS-induced ALI in mice.},

abstract = {We apply the one-dimensional reference interaction site model (RISM) to the solvation of uranyl in water. Uranyl aqua complexes with 4-6 explicit water ligands and an implicit water solvent, modeled by RISM to represent the further solvent environment, have been examined. The interaction of explicitly represented atoms of the aqua complexes are treated either by molecular mechanics or density functional theory, to build the free energy functional. A comparison of solvation energies and geometries of the aqua complexes for different numbers of explicit water ligands at the local minimum of the free energy surface indicate the interchangeability of explicit and implicit solvent models. Consequently the solvation energy is rather independent of the number of aqua ligands of the uranyl complex used as solute model, in contrast to results of a polarizable continuum model of solvation. For uranyl with four and five explicit water ligands in the first solvation shell we determined only a minor preference for the latter, in agreement with experiment. Other computational approaches tend to overestimate this preference.},

abstract = {The accurate computational prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters like chemical shifts represents a challenge if the species studied is immersed in strongly polarizing environments such as water. Common approaches to treating a solvent in the form of, e.g., the polarizable continuum model (PCM) ignore strong directional interactions such as H-bonds to the solvent which can have substantial impact on magnetic shieldings. We here present a computational methodology that accounts for atomic-level solvent effects on NMR parameters by extending the embedded cluster reference interaction site model (EC-RISM) integral equation theory to the prediction of chemical shifts of N-methylacetamide (NMA) in aqueous solution. We examine the influence of various so-called closure approximations of the underlying three- dimensional RISM theory as well as the impact of basis set size and different treatment of electrostatic solute−solvent interactions. We find considerable and systematic improve- ment over reference PCM and gas phase calculations. A smaller basis set in combination with a simple point charge model already yields good performance which can be further improved by employing exact electrostatic quantum-mechanical solute−solvent interaction energies. A larger basis set benefits more significantly from exact over point charge electrostatics, which can be related to differences of the solvent's charge distribution.},

In this study, we use a new docking protocol that combines a recently proposed explicit water placement algorithm based on the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation and conventional docking software (AutoDock Vina) to explain the mechanisms of maltotriose binding to the apo-open state of a maltose-binding protein. We confirm the predictions of previous NMR spectroscopic experiments on binding modes of the ligand. We provide the molecular details on the binding mode that was not previously observed in the X-ray experiments. We show that this mode, which is defined by the fine balance between the protein-ligand direct interactions and solvation effects, can trigger the protein's domain motion resulting in the holo-closed structure of the maltose-binding protein with the maltotriose ligand in excellent agreement with the experimental data. We also discuss the role of water in blocking unfavorable binding sites and water-mediated interactions contributing to the stability of observable binding modes of maltotriose.},

However, until now the details of these interactions are far from being fully understood. We present results of a theoretical study of the hydration of Pro zwitterion (Pro-ZW) in water in the temperature range of 298-248 K. The data were obtained by the integral equation method in the framework of the 1D- and 3D-RISM approaches. The structural data were analyzed in terms of radial and spatial distribution functions. The observed features of Pro-ZW hydration are discussed from the position of the biological role of Pro as a cryoprotectant. In particular, it was found that under cooling conditions this protectant is able to bind a significant amount of water molecules and, thus, is helping to keep water inside the cell.},

abstract = {It has been found that a cyclodextrin derivative, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cydodextrin (HP beta CD), has reasonable therapeutic effect on Niemann-Pick disease type C, which is caused by abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosomes and shortage of esterified cholesterol in other cellular compartments. We study the binding affinity and mode of HP beta CD with cholesterol to elucidate the possible mechanism of HP beta CD for removing cholesterol from the lysosomes. The dominant binding mode of HP beta CD with cholesterol is found based on the molecular dynamics simulation and a statistical mechanics theory of liquids, or the three-dimensional reference interaction site model theory with Kovalenko-Hirata closure relation. We examine the two types of complexes between HP beta CD and cholesterol, namely, one-to- one (1:1) and two-to-one (2:1). It is predicted that the 1:1 complex makes two or three types of stable binding mode in solution, in which the beta CD ring tends to be located at the edge of the steroid skeleton. For the 2:1 complex, there are four different types of the complex conceivable, depending on the orientation between the two HP beta CDs: head-to-head (HH), head-to-tail (HT), tail-to-head (TH), and tail-to-tail (TT). The HT and HH cyclodextrin dimers show higher affinity to cholesterol compared to the other dimers and to all the binding modes of 1:1 complexes. The physical reason why the HT and HH dimers have higher affinity compared to the other complexes is discussed based on the consistency with the 1:1 complex. On the one hand, in case of the HT and HH dimers, the position of each CD in the dimer along the cholesterol chain comes right on or close to one of the positions where a single CD makes a stable complex. On the other hand, one of the CD molecules is located on unstable region along the cholesterol chain, for the case of TH and TT dimers.},

abstract = {Direct correlation functions (DCFs) play a pivotal role in the applications of classical density functional theory (DFT) to addressing the thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous systems beyond the local-density or mean-field approximations. Whereas numerous studies have been dedicated to the radial distribution functions of liquid water--the most important solvent on earth, relatively little attention has been given to the site-site DCFs. The water DCFs are long-ranged and difficult to calculate directly by simulation, and the predictions from conventional liquid-state theories have been rarely calibrated. Here we report a computational procedure for accurate evaluation of the site-site DCFs of liquid water based on three popular molecular models (viz., SPC, SPC∕E, and TIP3P). The numerical results provide a benchmark for calibration of conventional liquid-state theories and fresh insights into development of new DFT methods. We show that: (1) the long-range behavior of the site-site DCFs depends on both the molecular model and the thermodynamic condition; (2) the asymptotic limit of DCFs at large distance does not follow the mean-spherical approximation (MSA); (3) individual site-site DCFs are long ranged ({\~{}}40 nm) but a summation of all DCF pairs exhibits only short-range behavior ({\~{}}1 nm or a few water diameters); (4) the site-site bridge correlation functions behave as the DCFs, i.e., they are also long-ranged while the summation of all bridge correlation functions is short ranged. Our analytical and numerical analyses of the DCFs provide some simple strategies for possible improvement of the numerical performance of conventional liquid-state theories.},

abstract = {It is well established that water-alcohol mixtures exhibit anomalous properties at very low as well as at very high alcohol concentrations. Almost all the studies in this regard intend to link these anomalies to the microscopic structural changes as water (or alcohol) concentration increases in the mixture. However, it is important to note that the nature of these structural changes could be different at the water- and TBA-rich concentrations. In this article, our goal is to address such structural change overs, if really present, in the mixtures of water and tert-butanol (TBA) by using simulated X-ray scattering structure function, S(q), real space radial and spatial distribution functions and heterogeneity order parameter. By using a judicial partitioning scheme, we show that structural characteristic of pure water is qualitatively retained for X TBA {\textless} 0.1. The simulated S(q) peaks at around q = 2 and q = 2.8 {\AA}−1, which correspond to water oxygen correlations, begin to fade away only after X TBA ≥ 0.1. This is a clear indication of microscopic structural transition at X TBA ≈ 0.1. Beyond X TBA = 0.1, the TBA structural features begin to take over to that of water. The peak at q =1.3 {\AA}−1 which primarily corresponds to nonpolar-nonpolar correlations in pure TBA begin to rise at X TBA ≈ 0.1. However, the pre-peak at around q = 0.75 {\AA}−1, which is due to polar-polar and nonpolar-polar correlations in pure TBA, seems to appear at lower q value only at the equi-molar concentration of the mixture. From the solvent cage surrounding the TBA molecules, we observe that while the aggregation of TBA alkyl groups, due to hydrophobic interaction, is maximum at 10{\%} TBA, the intervening hydrogen bonding interactions between water and TBA molecules tend to lower the hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl groups of alcohol with increasing concentration of TBA. In addition to this, we also observe dimers and small clusters of water molecules in the TBA-rich regime. The computed heterogeneity order parameters for the individual components of the mixture reveal enhanced non-uniform distribution of the TBA molecules near X TBA≈ 0.1 to 0.3. These results are also supported by the radial distribution functions and nearest neighbour coordination numbers of water and TBA oxygen atoms around TBA oxygen.

The calculated excitation energies were in good agreement with the experimental behavior. Analysis of the coordination numbers revealed preferential solvation by methanol. The free energy component analysis implied that solvent reorganization and solvation entropy drive the preferential solvation by methanol, while the direct solute-solvent interaction promotes solvation by water. The difference in the preferential solvation effect on the ground and excited states causes the nonlinear excitation energy shift.},

abstract = {In the conventional classical density functional theory (DFT) for simple fluids, an ideal gas is usually chosen as the reference system because there is a one-to-one correspondence between the external field and the density distribution function, and the exact intrinsic free-energy functional is available for the ideal gas. In this case, the second-order density functional Taylor series expansion of the excess intrinsic free-energy functional provides the hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation. Recently, it has been shown that the HNC approximation significantly overestimates the solvation free energy (SFE) for an infinitely dilute Lennard-Jones (LJ) solution, especially when the solute particles are several times larger than the solvent particles [T. Miyata and J. Thapa, Chem. Phys. Lett. 604, 122 (2014)]. In the present study, we propose a reference-modified density functional theory as a systematic approach to improve the SFE functional as well as the pair distribution functions. The second-order density functional Taylor series expansion for the excess part of the intrinsic free-energy functional in which a hard-sphere fluid is introduced as the reference system instead of an ideal gas is applied to the LJ pure and infinitely dilute solution systems and is proved to remarkably improve the drawbacks of the HNC approximation. Furthermore, the third-order density functional expansion approximation in which a factorization approximation is applied to the triplet direct correlation function is examined for the LJ systems. We also show that the third-order contribution can yield further refinements for both the pair distribution function and the excess chemical potential for the pure LJ liquids.},

The new 3D-RISM program achieved excellent scalability to the parallelization, running on the RIKEN K supercomputer. As a benchmark application, we employed the program, combined with molecular dynamics simulation, to analyze the oligomerization process of chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 mutant. The results demonstrate that the massive parallel 3D-RISM program is effective to analyze the hydration properties of the large biomolecular systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Improving the efficiency of free energy calculations is important for many biological and materials design applications, such as protein-ligand binding affinities in drug design, partitioning between immiscible liquids, and determining molecular association in soft materials. We show that for any pair potential, moderately accurate estimation of the radial distribution function for a solute molecule is sufficient to accurately estimate the statistical variance of a sampling along a free energy pathway. This allows inexpensive analytical identification of low statistical error free energy pathways. We employ a variety of methods to estimate the radial distribution function (RDF) and find that the computationally cheap two-body "dilute gas" limit performs as well or better than 3D-RISM theory and other approximations for identifying low variance free energy pathways. With a RDF estimate in hand, we can search for pairwise interaction potentials that produce low variance. We give an example of a search minimizing statistical variance of solvation free energy over the entire parameter space of a generalized "soft core" potential. The free energy pathway arising from this optimization procedure has lower curvature in the variance and reduces the total variance by at least 50{\%} compared to the traditional soft core solvation pathway. We also demonstrate that this optimized pathway allows free energies to be estimated with fewer intermediate states due to its low curvature. This free energy variance optimization technique is generalizable to solvation in any homogeneous fluid and for any type of pairwise potential and can be performed in minutes to hours, depending on the method used to estimate g(r).},

The mechanism of xylan binding by CBM36 and the role of Ca2+ were investigated by the combined use of molecular dynamics simulations and the 3D reference interaction site model method. The CBM36 showed affinity for xylan after Ca2+ binding, but not after Mg2+ binding. Free-energy component analysis of the xylan-binding process revealed that the major factor for xylan-binding affinity is the electrostatic interaction between the Ca2+ and the hydroxyl oxygens of xylan. The van der Waals interaction between the hydrophobic side chain of CBM36 and the glucopyranose ring of xylan also contributes to the stabilization of the xylan-binding state. Dehydration on the formation of the complex has the opposite effect on these interactions. The affinity of CBM36 for xylan results from a balance of the interactions between the binding ion and solvents, hydrophilic residues around xylan, and the hydroxyl oxygens of xylan. When CBM binds Ca2+, these interactions are well balanced; in contrast, when CBM binds Mg2+, the dehydration penalty is excessively large.},

abstract = {Solvation of transition metal complexes with water has been one of the fundamental topics in physical and coordination chemistry. In particular, Pt(II) complexes have recently attracted considerable interest for their relation to anticancer activity in cisplatin and its analogues, yet the interaction of the water molecule and the metal center has been obscured. The challenge from a theoretical perspective remains that both the microscopic solvation effect and the dynamical electron correlation (DEC) effect have to be treated simultaneously in a-reasonable manner. In this work we derive the analytical gradient for the three-dimensional reference interaction site model Moller-Plesset second order (3D-RISM-MP2) free energy. On the basis of the three-regions 3D-RISM self-consistent field (SCF) method recently proposed by us, we apply a new layer of the Z-vector method to the CP-RISM equation as well as point-charge approximation to the derivatives with respect to the density matrix elements in the RISM-CPHF equation to remarkably reduce the computational cost. This method is applied to study the interaction of H2O with the d(8) square planar transition metal complexes in aqueous solution, trans[(PtCl2)-Cl-II(NH3)(glycine)] (1a), [Pt-II(NH3)(4)](2+) (1b), [Pt-II(CN)(4)](2-) (1c), and their Pd(II) analogues 2a, 2b, and 2c, respectively, to elucidate whether the usual H2O interaction through O atom (O-ahead mode) or unusual one through H atom (H-ahead mode) is stable in these complexes. We find that the interaction energy of the coordinating water and the, transition metal complex changes little when switching from gas to aqueous phase, but the solvation free energy differs remarkably between the two interaction modes, thereby affecting the relative stability of the H-ahead and O-ahead modes. Particularly, in contrast to the expectation that the O-ahead mode is preferred due to the presence of positive charges in 1b, the H-ahead mode is also found to be more stable. The O-ahead mode is found to be more stable than the H-ahead one only in 2b. The energy decomposition analysis (EDA) at the 3D-RISM-MP2 level revealed that the O-ahead mode is stabilized by the electrostatic (ES) interaction, whereas the H-ahead one is mainly stabilized by the DEC effect. The ES interaction is also responsible for the difference between the Pd(II) and Pt(11) complexes; because the electrostatic potential is more negative along the z-axis in the Pt(II) complex than in the Pd(II) one, the O-ahead mode prefers the Pd(II) complexes, whereas the H-ahead becomes predominant in the Pt(II) complexes.},

The density fluctuations plotted against density show finite maxima along a line slightly off from the critical isochore, in accordance with experimental results. The microscopic structures of water on both regions that were separated by the line were investigated by analyzing the site-site radial distribution functions. The analysis clearly indicates that the structure is determined by the two effects featuring liquid states: the packing or volume exclusion effect and the screening of the Coulomb interaction or the hydrogen bond, both becoming more important at higher densities. An interplay of the two effects creates maxima of the density fluctuation in the supercritical region of water.},

abstract = {Current oil sand mining operations in the Athabasca basin are predominantly aqueous-based. Extracts containing large amounts of fines lead to the formation of stable organoclay suspensions in froths giving lower yields and greater tailing wastes and making the development of more efficient extraction methods desirable from both economical and environmental perspectives. We examine an indole-kaolinite system as a model for these oil fines and their resistance to washing in nonaqueous solvents. The prepared organoclays show indole loading exclusively on the external surface of the clay. Micron-scaled vermicular structures, similar to natural kaolinite, are observed. Their formation is believed to be driven by strong adsorbate?adsorbate interactions. Indole is the primary adsorbate, as solvent adsorption is shown to be minimal based on both experimental and computational results. Isotherms are constructed and parameters calculated from linear regression analysis fitted to the Brunauer?Emmett?Teller equation. Monolayer quantities calculated match well to the theoretical amount calculated from surface areas measurements. Washing the organoclays with both toluene and isopropanol results in a 50{\%} decrease of loaded organic material, leaving a monolayer equivalent of organic matter. The statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation is employed to perform full sampling of solvent orientations around a kaolinite platelet and gain insights into the preferred orientation and adsorption thermodynamics of indole on kaolinite in toluene and heptane solvents. In its preferred orientation, indole is hydrogen-bonded to one or two O atoms at the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite. The calculated solvation free energy and potential of mean force for adsorption of indole and solvents on kaolinite in solution yield the increasing adsorption strength order of heptane {\textless} toluene {\textless} indole on the aluminum hydroxide surface. Multilayer adsorption profiles are predicted based on the integrated three-dimensional distribution functions of indole, toluene, and heptane.},

abstract = {A new approach to investigate a molecular recognition process of protein is presented based on the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory, a statistical mechanics theory of molecular liquids. Numerical procedure for solving the conventional 3D-RISM equation consists of two steps. In step 1, we solve ordinary RISM (or 1D-RISM) equations for a solvent mixture including target ligands in order to obtain the density pair correlation functions (PCF) among molecules in the solution. Then, we solve the 3D-RISM equation for a solute--solvent system to find three-dimensional density distribution functions (3D-DDF) of solvent species around a protein, using PCF obtained in the first step. A key to the success of the method was to regard a target ligand as one of ``solvent''species. However, the success is limited due to a difficulty of solving the 1D-RISM equation for a solvent mixture, including large ligand molecules. In the present paper, we propose a method which eases the limitation concerning solute size in the conventional method. In this approach, we solve a solute--solute 3D-RISM equations for a protein--ligand system in which both proteins and ligands are regarded as ``solutes''at infinite dilution. The 3D- and 1D-RISM equations are solved for protein--solvent and ligand--solvent systems, respectively, in order to obtain the 3D- and 1D-DDF of solvent around the solutes, which are required for solving the solute--solute 3D-RISM equation. The method is applied to two practical and noteworthy examples concerning pharmaceutical design. One is an odorant binding protein in the Drosophila melanogaster, which binds an ethanol molecule. The other is phospholipase A2, which is known as a receptor of acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin. The result indicates that the method successfully reproduces the binding mode of the ligand molecules in the binding sites measured by the experiments.},

abstract = {We have studied the accuracy of Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) integral equation theory in terms of the solvation free energy (SFE) for a two-component Lennard-Jones system at the infinite dilution limit. We have employed the hypernetted chain (HNC), Kovalenko-Hirata (KH), Kobryn-Gusarov-Kovalenko (KGK), and Percus-Yevick (PY) closure equations. Further, we have extended the Verlet-modified (VM) closure to the two-component system to examine the accuracy of this method in terms of the SFE. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to compare the results with the above mentioned OZ theories. The HNC and KH approximations significantly overestimate the SFE, whereas the PY approximation tends to underestimate it. The overestimation of the SFE by the KGK approximation becomes significant when the solvent density is relatively high. In contrast, the VM approximation is found to be rather accurate at all studied conditions. An analysis of the integrand for the SFE reveals that, to improve the SFE, the first rising (FR) region in the radial distribution function (RDF) must be corrected. We have also tested the sigma-enlarging-bridge (SEB) function that we proposed previously [T. Miyata and Y. Ebato, J. Mol. Liq. 217 (2016) 75] for the correction of the FR region of the RDF. In this study, we applied the SEB function to both HNC-type and KH-type closures and found that these combinations (SEB-HNC and SEB-KH) improve the SFE significantly.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Given that association and dissociation of protein molecules is crucial in most biological processes several in silico methods have been recently developed to predict protein-protein interactions. Structural evidence has shown that usually interacting pairs of close homologs (interologs) physically interact in the same way. Moreover, conservation of an interaction depends on the conservation of the interface between interacting partners. In this article we make use of both, structural similarities among domains of known interacting proteins found in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) and conservation of pairs of sequence patches involved in protein-protein interfaces to predict putative protein interaction pairs. RESULTS: We have obtained a large amount of putative protein-protein interaction (approximately 130,000). The list is independent from other techniques both experimental and theoretical. We separated the list of predictions into three sets according to their relationship with known interacting proteins found in DIP. For each set, only a small fraction of the predicted protein pairs could be independently validated by cross checking with the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). The fraction of validated protein pairs was always larger than that expected by using random protein pairs. Furthermore, a correlation map of interacting protein pairs was calculated with respect to molecular function, as defined in the Gene Ontology database. It shows good consistency of the predicted interactions with data in the HPRD database. The intersection between the lists of interactions of other methods and ours produces a network of potentially high-confidence interactions.},

Our method utilizes 3D-RISM calculations to quickly obtain equilibrium solvent distributions without either necessity of simulation or limits of solvent sampling. Our analysis of these distributions extracts highest likelihood poses of solvent as well as localized entropies, enthalpies, and solvation free energies. We demonstrate our method on a structure of HIV-1 protease where excellent structural and thermodynamic data are available for comparison. Our results, obtained within minutes, show systematic agreement with available experimental data. Further, our results are in good agreement with established simulation-based solvent analysis methods.

abstract = {The composition of the ion atmosphere surrounding nucleic acids affects their folding, condensation and binding to other molecules. It is thus of fundamental importance to gain predictive insight into the formation of the ion atmosphere and thermodynamic consequences when varying ionic conditions. An early step toward this goal is to benchmark computational models against quantitative experimental measurements. Herein, we test the ability of the three dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) to reproduce preferential interaction parameters determined from ion counting (IC) experiments for mixed alkali chlorides and dsDNA. Calculations agree well with experiment with slight deviations for salt concentrations {\textgreater}200 mM and capture the observed trend where the extent of cation accumulation around the DNA varies inversely with its ionic size. Ion distributions indicate that the smaller, more competitive cations accumulate to a greater extent near the phosphoryl groups, penetrating deeper into the grooves. In accord with experiment, calculated IC profiles do not vary with sequence, although the predicted ion distributions in the grooves are sequence and ion size dependent. Calculations on other nucleic acid conformations predict that the variation in linear charge density has a minor effect on the extent of cation competition.},

abstract = {We present two hybrid solvation models for the calculation of the solvation structure with model 1 in a confined nanospace in bulk materials and model 2 at solid/liquid interfaces where an electrode is in contact with an electrolyte and a membrane is immersed into a solution. The hybrid theory is based on the reference interaction site method (RISM) for the solvent region. The electronic structure of a bulk material, an electrode, and a membrane is treated by density functional theory with the plane-wave basis and pseudopotentials technique. For model 1, we use the three-dimensional RISM (3D-RISM) by imposing a 3D periodic boundary condition on the system. However, for model 2, we reformulate the RISM by means of a two-dimensional boundary condition parallel to the surface and an open boundary condition normal to the surface. Four benchmark calculations are performed for the formaldehyde-water system, water packed into a zeolite framework, a NaCl solution in contact with an Al electrode, and an Al thin film immersed in a NaCl solution with different concentrations. The calculations are shown to be efficient and stable. Because of the flexibility of the RISM theory, the models are considered to be applicable to a wide range of solid/liquid interfaces.},

abstract = {We developed a technique to decrease memory requirements when solving the integral equations of three-dimensional (3D) molecular theory of solvation, a.k.a. 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM), using the modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace (MDIIS) numerical method of generalized minimal residual type. The latter provides robust convergence, in particular, for charged systems and electrolyte solutions with strong associative effects for which damped iterations do not converge. The MDIIS solver (typically, with 2 × 10 iterative vectors of argument and residual for fast convergence) treats the solute excluded volume (core), while handling the solvation shells in the 3D box with two vectors coupled with MDIIS iteratively and incorporating the electrostatic asymptotics outside the box analytically. For solvated systems from small to large macromolecules and solid-liquid interfaces, this results in 6- to 16-fold memory reduction and corresponding CPU load decrease in MDIIS. We illustrated the new technique on solvated systems of chemical and biomolecular relevance with different dimensionality, both in ambient water and aqueous electrolyte solution, by solving the 3D-RISM equations with the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure, and the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure where convergent. This core-shell-asymptotics technique coupling MDIIS for the excluded volume core with iteration of the solvation shells converges as efficiently as MDIIS for the whole 3D box and yields the solvation structure and thermodynamics without loss of accuracy. Although being of benefit for solutes of any size, this memory reduction becomes critical in 3D-RISM calculations for large solvated systems, such as macromolecules in solution with ions, ligands, and other cofactors.},

abstract = {The salt effect on the intramolecular proton transfer reaction of glycine in aqueous NaCl solution was considered using the reference interaction-site model self-consistent field theory. The free energy profiles were computed for various salt concentrations. The set of profiles clearly showed that the free energy gap between the zwitterionic form (ZW) and the neutral form (NF) became larger as the NaCl concentration increased. The transition-state structure of the solute glycine approaches the NF structure, and the reaction barrier height is reduced. From the energy decomposition analysis of the free energy of solvation, we found that the changes in the solvation free energy are determined by the balance between the electronic distortion energy, the electrostatic interaction, the solvent reorganization, and the entropic effects caused by the NaCl addition. The salt effect of NaCl makes all the species associated with the reaction unstable; however, the destabilization of NFs caused by NaCl addition is stronger than that of ZWs. In the ZW, the penalty coming from the solvent reorganization and the entropic effects are compensated by the strong solute-solvent electrostatic interaction.},

abstract = {Although better means to model the properties of bulk heterojunction molecular blends are much needed in the field of organic optoelectronics, only a small subset of methods based on molecular dynamics- and Monte Carlo-based approaches have been hitherto employed to guide or replace empirical characterization and testing. Here, we present the first use of the integral equation theory of molecular liquids in modelling the structural properties of blends of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a carboxylated poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT), respectively. For this, we use the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) with the Universal Force Field (UFF) to compute the microscopic structure of blends and obtain insight into the miscibility of its components. Input parameters for RISM, such as optimized molecular geometries and charge distribution of interaction sites, are derived by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We also run Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to compare the diffusivity of the PCBM in binary blends with P3HT and P3BT, respectively. A remarkably good agreement with available experimental data and results of alternative modelling/simulation is observed for PCBM in the P3HT system. We interpret this as a step in the validation of the use of our approach for organic photovoltaics and support of its results for new systems that do not have reference data for comparison or calibration. In particular, for the less-studied P3BT, our results show that expectations about its performance in binary blends with PCBM may be overestimated, as it does not demonstrate the required level of miscibility and short-range structural organization. In addition, the simulated mobility of PCBM in P3BT is somewhat higher than what is expected for polymer blends and falls into a range typical for fluids. The significance of our predictive multi-scale modelling lies in the insights it offers into nanoscale morphology and charge transport behaviour in multi-component organic semiconductor blends.},

The resulting TBA solute-correlated (SC) spectra reveal perturbed water OH features arising from the hydration-shell of TBA as well as shifts in the TBA CH vibrational frequency arising from TBA-TBA interactions. Our results indicate that at low concentrations (below [similar]0.5 M), there is virtually no TBA aggregation. The first aggregates formed above 0.5 M remain highly hydrated, while those formed above [similar]2 M are significantly less hydrated. Comparisons with predictions pertaining to a randomly mixed (non-aggregating) solution indicate that below [similar]1 M there are fewer TBA-TBA contacts than would be present in a random mixture, thus implying that the thermodynamic stability of the first hydration-shell of TBA suppresses the formation of direct contact aggregates at low TBA concentrations. Our results further suggest that microheterogeneous domains containing many water-separated TBA-TBA contacts form near a TBA concentration of [similar]1 M, while at higher concentrations the TBA-rich domain size distribution may resemble that in a non-aggregating random mixture.},

abstract = {A new method is introduced to compute X-ray solution scattering profiles from atomic models of macromolecules. The three-dimensional version of the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) from liquid-state statistical mechanics is employed to compute the solvent distribution around the solute, including both water and ions. X-ray scattering profiles are computed from this distribution together with the solute geometry. We describe an efficient procedure for performing this calculation employing a Lebedev grid for the angular averaging. The intensity profiles (which involve no adjustable parameters) match experiment and molecular dynamics simulations up to wide angle for two proteins (lysozyme and myoglobin) in water, as well as the small-angle profiles for a dozen biomolecules taken from the BioIsis.net database. The RISM model is especially well-suited for studies of nucleic acids in salt solution. Use of fiber-diffraction models for the structure of duplex DNA in solution yields close agreement with the observed scattering profiles in both the small and wide angle scattering (SAXS and WAXS) regimes. In addition, computed profiles of anomalous SAXS signals (for Rb(+) and Sr(2+)) emphasize the ionic contribution to scattering and are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In cases where an absolute calibration of the experimental data at q = 0 is available, one can extract a count of the excess number of waters and ions; computed values depend on the closure that is assumed in the solution of the Ornstein-Zernike equations, with results from the Kovalenko-Hirata closure being closest to experiment for the cases studied here.},

Herein, we discuss the stability of the folded and unfolded structures of proteins obtained from Anton's long simulations (Lindorff-Larsen, K.; Piana, S.; Dror, R. O.; Shaw, D.E. Science, 2011, 334, 517-520). Specifically, the stabilities of CLN025, the WW domain variant GTT, the triple mutant of the redesigned protein G variant NuG2, and the de novo-designed three-helix bundle protein are investigated. The solvation free energy of the structures is calculated using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the reference-modified density functional theory. The total energy is given by the sum of the conformational energy and the solvation free energy, and their balance results in the stabilization of protein structure, as demonstrated by the correspondence between structures with the lowest total energy of all proteins to their native structures. Overall, these findings indicate that the total energy function is appropriate for evaluating the stability of protein folding systems. Moreover, decomposing the energy terms reveals that proteins achieve their stabilities from the balance between the conformational energy and the solvation free energy. In particular, the solvation entropy is the main contributor to the process of folding from more extended structures to compact structures. The native structure is more stable than the compact structure owing to competition between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. },

abstract = {The Stokes shift magnitudes for coumarin 153 (C153) in 13 organic solvents with various polarities have been determined by means of steady-state spectroscopy and reference interaction-site model-self-consistent-field (RISM-SCF) theory. RISM-SCF calculations have reproduced experimental results fairly well, including individual solvent characteristics. It is empirically known that in some solvents, larger Stokes shift magnitudes are detected than anticipated on the basis of the solvent relative permittivity, ɛr. In practice, 1,4-dioxane (ɛr = 2.21) provides almost identical Stokes shift magnitudes to that of tetrahydrofuran (THF, ɛr = 7.58), for C153 and other typical organic solutes. In this work, RISM-SCF theory has been used to estimate the energetics of C153-solvent systems involved in the absorption and fluorescence processes. The Stokes shift magnitudes estimated by RISM-SCF theory are ∼5 kJ mol(-1) (400 cm(-1)) less than those determined by spectroscopy; however, the results obtained are still adequate for dipole moment comparisons, in a qualitative sense. We have also calculated the solute-solvent site-site radial distributions by this theory. It is shown that solvation structures with respect to the C-O-C framework, which is common to dioxane and THF, in the near vicinity (∼0.4 nm) of specific solute sites can largely account for their similar Stokes shift magnitudes. In previous works, such solute-solvent short-range interactions have been explained in terms of the higher-order multipole moments of the solvents. Our present study shows that along with the short-range interactions that contribute most significantly to the energetics, long-range electrostatic interactions are also important. Such long-range interactions are effective up to 2 nm from the solute site, as in the case of a typical polar solvent, acetonitrile.},

At the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level, geometry optimization is found to give two transition states (TSs); one is the PCET type with two benzene rings being nearly coplanar, and the other is the HAT type with two benzene rings taking a stacking structure. Geometry optimization at the (semilocal) DFT level, on the other hand, is found to give only one transition state (i.e., the PCET-type one) and fail to obtain the stacking TS structure. By comparing various levels of theories (including long-range corrected DFT functionals), we demonstrate that the Hartree-Fock exchange at long range plays a critical role in obtaining the sufficient stacking stabilization of the present open-shell system, and that the sole addition of empirical dispersion correction to semilocal DFT functionals may not be adequate for describing such a stacking interaction. Next, we investigate the solvent effect on the PCET and HAT TS thus obtained using the reference interaction site model self-consistent field (RISM-SCF) method. The results suggest that the free energy barrier increases with increasing polarity of the solvent, and that the solvent effects are stronger for the PCET TS than the stacking HAT TS pathway. The reason for this is discussed based on the dipole moment of different TS structures in solution.},

abstract = {We develop efficient handling of solvation forces in the multiscale method of multiple time step molecular dynamics (MTS-MD) of a biomolecule steered by the solvation free energy (effective solvation forces) obtained from the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation (three-dimensional reference interaction site model complemented with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure approximation). To reduce the computational expenses, we calculate the effective solvation forces acting on the biomolecule by using advanced solvation force extrapolation (ASFE) at inner time steps while converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations only at large outer time steps. The idea of ASFE consists in developing a discrete non-Eckart rotational transformation of atomic coordinates that minimizes the distances between the atomic positions of the biomolecule at different time moments. The effective solvation forces for the biomolecule in a current conformation at an inner time step are then extrapolated in the transformed subspace of those at outer time steps by using a modified least square fit approach applied to a relatively small number of the best force-coordinate pairs. The latter are selected from an extended set collecting the effective solvation forces obtained from 3D-RISM-KH at outer time steps over a broad time interval. The MTS-MD integration with effective solvation forces obtained by converging 3D-RISM-KH at outer time steps and applying ASFE at inner time steps is stabilized by employing the optimized isokinetic Nos{\'{e}}-Hoover chain (OIN) ensemble. Compared to the previous extrapolation schemes used in combination with the Langevin thermostat, the ASFE approach substantially improves the accuracy of evaluation of effective solvation forces and in combination with the OIN thermostat enables a dramatic increase of outer time steps. We demonstrate on a fully flexible model of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution that the MTS-MD/OIN/ASFE/3D-RISM-KH multiscale method of molecular dynamics steered by effective solvation forces allows huge outer time steps up to tens of picoseconds without affecting the equilibrium and conformational properties, and thus provides a 100- to 500-fold effective speedup in comparison to conventional MD with explicit solvent. With the statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM-KH account for effective solvation forces, the method provides efficient sampling of biomolecular processes with slow and/or rare solvation events such as conformational transitions of hydrated alanine dipeptide with the mean life times ranging from 30 ps up to 10 ns for "flip-flop" conformations, and is particularly beneficial for biomolecular systems with exchange and localization of solvent and ions, ligand binding, and molecular recognition.},

Ferrocene was chosen as a guest molecule because it is a good mimic for a small drug molecule in terms of logP value. The present computational study predicts that ferrocene can penetrate the channel of all three RNTs examined, however, the potential of mean force profile along the RNT channel suggested that RNT that has the smallest channel diameter has relatively high potential barrier for uptake and release of ferrocene, and therefore it was suggested that this could be a suitable mechanism to trap (during self-assembly) and release (during disassembly) a drug candidate. This work suggests also that tuning the RNT channel dimensions and chemistry should allow us to develop a palette of RNT delivery systems for a variety of drugs.},

abstract = {Molecular tunnels in enzyme systems possess variable architecture and are therefore difficult to predict. In this work, we design and apply an algorithm to resolve the pathway followed by ammonia using the bifunctional enzyme formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (FGAR-AT) as a model system. Though its crystal structure has been determined, an ammonia pathway connecting the glutaminase domain to the 30 A distal FGAR/ATP binding site remains elusive. Crystallography suggested two purported paths: an N-terminal-adjacent path (path 1) and an auxiliary ADP-adjacent path (path 2). The algorithm presented here, RismPath, which enables fast and accurate determination of solvent distribution inside a protein channel, predicted path 2 as the preferred mode of ammonia transfer. Supporting experimental studies validate the identity of the path, and results lead to the conclusion that the residues in the middle of the channel do not partake in catalytic coupling and serve only as channel walls facilitating ammonia transfer.},

abstract = {Modeling solute polarizability is a key ingredient for improving the description of solvation phenomena. In recent years, polarizable molecular mechanics force fields have emerged that circumvent the limitations of classical fixed charge force fields by the ability to adapt their electrostatic potential distribution to a polarizing environment. Solvation phenomena are characterized by the solute's excess chemical potential, which can be computed by expensive fully atomistic free energy simulations. The alternative is to employ an implicit solvent model, which poses a challenge to the formulation of the solute−solvent interaction term within a polarizable framework. Here, we adapt the threedimensional reference interaction site model (3D RISM) integral equation theory as a solvent model, which analytically yields the chemical potential, to the polarizable AMOEBA force field using an embedding cluster (EC-RISM) strategy. The methodology is analogous to our earlier approach to the coupling of a quantum-chemical solute description with a classical 3D RISM solvent. We describe the conceptual physical and algorithmic basis as well as the performance for several benchmark cases as a proof of principle. The results consistently show reasonable agreement between AMOEBA and quantum-chemical free energies in solution in general and allow for separate assessment of energetic and solvation-related contributions. We find that, depending on the parametrization, AMOEBA reproduces the chemical potential in better agreement with reference quantumchemical calculations than the intramolecular energies, which suggests possible routes toward systematic improvement of polarizable force fields.},

In order to solve the interaction problem of nano-channel atom and methane molecule, the coarse-grained methane model and the classical Berthelot-Lorentz mixing rules are employed. The optimized coarse-grained methane models are determined using the relative entropy minimization method. The density distribution, stress force profile and velocity profile of coarse-grained models are compared with the fully atomistic models for different nano-channel widths. It is concluded that the results of coarse-grained model are in reasonable agreement with those of the corresponding fully atomistic model. Furthermore, the value of viscosity is calculated by fitting the velocity profile to the continuum solution from the Navier-Stokes equations and then compared to experimental value. The results show that the MOPLS and CGMOPLS models could well predict the viscosity of methane fluid, while the OPLS model performed worst. All simulation results indicate that the coarse-grained models can be used to predict the viscosity of methane fluid accurately.},

abstract = {We present a method of DPD simulation based on a coarse-grained effective pair potential obtained from the DRISM-KH molecular theory of solvation. The theory is first used to calculate the radial distribution functions of all-atom solute monomers in all-atom solvent and then to invert them into an effective pair potential between coarse-grained beads such that their fluid without solvent accounts for molecular specificities and solvation effects in the all-atom system. Bonded interactions are sampled in relatively short MD of the all-atom system and modeled with best multi-Gaussian fit. Replacing the heuristically defined conservative force potential in DPD, the coarse-grained effective pair potential is free from the artificial restrictions on potential range and shape and on equal volume of solute and solvent blobs inherent in standard DPD. The procedure is flexible in specifying coarse-grained mapping and enormously increases computational efficiency by eliminating solvent. The method is validated on polystyrene chains of various length in toluene at finite concentrations for room and polystyrene glass transition temperature. It yields the chain elastic properties and diffusion coefficient in good agreement with experiment and all-atom MD simulations. DPD with coarse-grained effective pair potential is capable of predicting both structural and dynamic properties of polymer solutions and soft matter with high accuracy and computational efficiency.},

We use a fragment-based approach as a strategy to map chemical functionality on the internal surfaces. A few "multifunctional" ligand-binding sites, which recognize various types of functional groups, are detected inside the porter domain. Spatial links between the multifunctional sites indicate a probable multidrug efflux pathway. The frustrated environment of the protein cavity constructed of weak interactions between ligand and protein may be a mechanism for allowing smooth transportation through the protein. Guided diffusion appears to be the main mechanism for efflux.},

Integral equation theories give accurate predictions for pressure and radial distribution functions, whereas the temperatures where anomalies occur are underestimated. Upon increasing the elongation, the RISM theory still predicts the existence of anomalies; the latter are no longer observed in simulations, since their development is likely precluded by the onset of crystallization.

Here we use the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) statistical-mechanical solvation theory, with a well tested water model and a new united atom cyclohexane model, to calculate partition coefficients for the SAMPL5 dataset. The cyclohexane model performed well in training and testing ([Formula: see text] for amino acid neutral side chain analogues) but only if a parameterized solvation free energy correction was used. In contrast, the same protocol, using single solute conformations, performed poorly on the SAMPL5 dataset, obtaining [Formula: see text] compared to the reference partition coefficients, likely due to the much larger solute sizes. Including solute conformational sampling through molecular dynamics coupled with 3D-RISM (MD/3D-RISM) improved agreement with the reference calculation to [Formula: see text]. Since our initial calculations only considered partition coefficients and not distribution coefficients, solute sampling provided little benefit comparing against experiment, where ionized and tautomer states are more important. Applying a simple [Formula: see text] correction improved agreement with experiment from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], despite a small number of outliers.

In addition to adsorption, we also examine solvent-mediated effective interactions between two kaolinite nanoparticles in organic and aqueous solutions. The proposed adsorption model serves as a simple prototype of suspensions formed during nonaqueous extraction of bitumen from oil sands of the Athabasca Basin. Using the proposed computational approach, excess adsorption isotherms of bitumen fragments on two different faces of kaolinite were calculated and compared in cyclohexane and toluene solvents at several temperatures. Almost all the studied molecules show strong preference for adsorption on the octahedral aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite. While adsorption of the molecules on the tetrahedral silicon oxide surface is weaker, it is still significant compared to the octahedral surface and for some of the studied molecules adsorption appears to be stronger than for the octahedral surface. Due to the better surface and bulk solvation properties of toluene, the adsorption of the bitumen fragments in toluene is weaker than in cyclohexane. Potentials of mean force between kaolinite nanoplatelets in cyclohexane at several temperatures were calculated using the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation. Evaluation of effective interactions by conventional molecular simulation techniques generally requires costly free energy integration and therefore is usually avoided by adopting simple and often unrealistic semiempirical effective potentials. On the other hand, the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation offers a fully atomistic description with all-atom force fields and notable performance advantages over molecular simulations. Obtained in this way potentials of mean force in organic solvents exhibit complex oscillating behavior and generally possess deeper main minima and smaller aggregation barriers than the corresponding potentials in aqueous solution.},

abstract = {We developed a generalized solvation force extrapolation (GSFE) approach to speed up multiple time step molecular dynamics (MTS-MD) of biomolecules steered with mean solvation forces obtained from the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation (three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure). GSFE is based on a set of techniques including the non-Eckart-like transformation of coordinate space separately for each solute atom, extension of the force-coordinate pair basis set followed by selection of the best subset, balancing the normal equations by modified least-squares minimization of deviations, and incremental increase of outer time step in motion integration. Mean solvation forces acting on the biomolecule atoms in conformations at successive inner time steps are extrapolated using a relatively small number of best (closest) solute atomic coordinates and corresponding mean solvation forces obtained at previous outer time steps by converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations. The MTS-MD evolution steered with GSFE of 3D-RISM-KH mean solvation forces is efficiently stabilized with our optimized isokinetic Nos{\'{e}}-Hoover chain (OIN) thermostat. We validated the hybrid MTS-MD/OIN/GSFE/3D-RISM-KH integrator on solvated organic and biomolecules of different stiffness and complexity: asphaltene dimer in toluene solvent, hydrated alanine dipeptide, miniprotein 1L2Y, and protein G. The GSFE accuracy and the OIN efficiency allowed us to enlarge outer time steps up to huge values of 1-4 ps while accurately reproducing conformational properties. Quasidynamics steered with 3D-RISM-KH mean solvation forces achieves time scale compression of conformational changes coupled with solvent exchange, resulting in further significant acceleration of protein conformational sampling with respect to real time dynamics. Overall, this provided a 50- to 1000-fold effective speedup of conformational sampling for these systems, compared to conventional MD with explicit solvent. We have been able to fold the miniprotein from a fully denatured, extended state in about 60 ns of quasidynamics steered with 3D-RISM-KH mean solvation forces, compared to the average physical folding time of 4-9 $\mu$s observed in experiment.},

abstract = {Calculating the geometry and energy of a molecule in a solution is one of the most important tasks in chemistry. However, performing an accurate calculation in a solution is still a difficult task because the electronic structure and solute-solvent interactions are required to be accurately evaluated with an efficient computational cost. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed the coupled cluster with single and double excitations and perturbative triple excitations combined with the reference interaction site model (RISM) by employing our fitting approach. Our method correctly reproduced the relative stabilities of 1,2,3-triazole, isonicotinic acid, cytosine, and 6-chloro-2-pyridone in the aqueous phase, whereas the dielectric continuum model provided incorrect results for isonicotinic acid and 6-chloro-2-pyridone. Our method provided accurate results because the RISM captured the local solvation structure, such as hydrogen bonds.},

Rev. E, 1993, 48, 2898] and classical density functional theory. We show that Chandler's results concerning the solvation of a hard core of arbitrary shape can be recovered by either minimising a linearised HNC functional using an auxiliary Lagrange multiplier field to impose a vanishing density inside the core, or by minimising this functional directly outside the core --- indeed a simpler procedure. Those equivalent approaches are compared to two other variants of DFT, either in the HNC, or partially linearised HNC approximation, for the solvation of a Lennard-Jones solute of increasing size in a Lennard-Jones solvent. Compared to Monte-Carlo simulations, all those theories give acceptable results for the inhomogeneous solvent structure, but are completely out-of-range for the solvation free-energies. This can be fixed in DFT by adding a hard-sphere bridge correction to the HNC functional.},

Much attention has recently been focused on the use of mixtures of ionic liquids and some solvents (so-called organic electrolyte solutions, OESs) as efficient cellulose dissolution solvents, but many of the cosolvents used lack green credentials—a perennial problem where dipolar aprotic solvents are the solvents of choice. We present a rational approach, based on definition of ranges of solvent parameters gathered together in recently published databases, to find “greener” cosolvents for OES formation. Thus, $\gamma$-butyrolactone is identified as a suitable OES former for dissolution of microcrystalline cellulose and biobased $\gamma$-valerolactone as a marginally less efficient, but significantly safer, alternative.

In this contribution, combining experiment and theory, the hydration and ion-binding of this zwitterionic compound was studied to gain information on the functioning of ectoine in particular and of osmolytes in general. Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy was used to determine the effective hydration number of ectoine and its effective dipole moment in aqueous solutions with and without added NaCl. The obtained experimental data were compared with structural results from 1D-RISM and 3D-RISM calculations. It was found that ectoine is strongly hydrated, even in the presence of high salt concentrations. Upon addition of NaCl, ions are bound to ectoine but the formed complexes are not very stable. Interestingly, this osmolyte strongly rises the static relative permittivity of its solutions, shielding thus effectively long-range Coulomb interactions among ions in ectoine-containing solutions. We believe that via this effect, which should be common to all zwitterionic osmolytes, ectoine protects against excessive ions within the cell in addition to its strong osmotic activity protecting against ions outside.},

Changing the amount and composition of branches attached to the hemicellulose backbone can significantly alter the cell wall strength and microstructure. We address the effect of hemicellulose composition on primary cell wall assembly forces by using the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation, which provides statistical−mechanical sampling and molecular picture of hemicellulose arrangement around cellulose. We show that hemicellulose branches of arabinose, glucuronic acid, and especially glucuronate strengthen the primary cell wall by strongly coordinating to hydrogen bond donor sites on the cellulose surface. We reveal molecular forces maintaining the cell wall structure and provide directions for genetic modulation of plants and pretreatment design to render biomass more amenable to processing.},

The effects of temperature or/and fluid density on the structural changes are analyzed. It was established that rising temperature and decreasing density have a similar effect with regard to the decrease of the average number of H-bonds per water molecule and to thermal dehydration of the ions. On the other hand, ion association is mainly affected by rising temperature and this effect is largest in the subcritical region.

abstract = {The three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) method was efficiently implemented in the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method. The method is referred to as the FMO/3D-RISM method, and allows us to treat electronic structure of the whole of a macromolecule, such as a protein, as well as the solvent distribution around a solute macromolecule. The formalism of the FMO/3D-RISM method, for the computationally available form and variational expressions, are proposed in detail. A major concern leading to the implementation of the method was decreasing the computational costs involved in calculating the electrostatic potential, because the electrostatic potential is calculated on numerous grid points in three-dimensional real space in the 3D-RISM method. In this article, we propose a procedure for decreasing the computational costs involved in calculating the electrostatic potential in the FMO method framework. The strategy involved in this procedure is to evaluate the electrostatic potential and the solvated Fock matrix in different manners, depending on the distance between the solute and the solvent. The electrostatic potential is evaluated directly in the vicinity of the solute molecule by integrating the molecular orbitals of monomer fragments of the solute molecule, whereas the electrostatic potential is described as the sum of multipole interactions when an analog of the fast multipole method is used. The efficiency of our method was demonstrated by applying it to a water trimer system and three biomolecular systems. The FMO/3D-RISM calculation can be performed within a reasonable computational time, retaining the accuracy of some physical properties.},

One-electron oxidized salen complexes of Mn( iii ) and Ni( ii ) were recently reported to be unique mixed-valence compounds. Their electronic structures are sensitive to the salen ligand and solvation. We systematically investigated a series of one-electron oxidized salen complexes of group 7 metals (Mn( iii ), Tc( iii ), and Re( iii )) and their group 10 analogues (Ni( ii ), Pd( ii ), and Pt( ii )) using the general multi-configuration reference quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (GMC-QDPT) which was combined with the three-dimensional reference interaction site model self-consistent field theory (3D-RISM-SCF) to incorporate the solvation effect. The calculated absorption spectra and electronic structures agree with the experimental observation. The one-electron oxidized salen complexes of group 10 metals with a symmetrical salen ligand have a delocalized electronic structure belonging to class III (Robin–Day classification) in weakly polar solvents. The tendency for taking a delocalized electronic structure increases in the order Pd( ii ) {\textless} Ni( ii ) {\textless} Pt( ii ). When the salen ligand is asymmetrical, the one-electron oxidized complexes have a localized electronic structure belonging to class II. The group 7 analogues of Mn( iii ) and Tc( iii ) have a localized electronic structure belonging to class II even in weakly polar solvents and even with a symmetrical salen ligand. However, the one-electron oxidized Re( iii ) complex has no mixed-valence nature because one-electron oxidation occurs on the Re center. Theoretical study shows that the solvation effect plays a crucial role in determining the mixed-valence character, class II or III, and thereby its incorporation in the calculation is indispensable for correctly describing geometries, electronic structures, and the inter-valence absorption spectra of these complexes. The d orbital energy is one of the most important factors for determining the localization/delocalization electronic structures in these complexes. Detailed discussion of these factors is presented. },

abstract = {Background Living systems are characterized by the dynamic assembly and disassembly of biomolecules. The dynamical ordering mechanism of these biomolecules has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The main theoretical approaches include quantum mechanical (QM) calculation, all-atom (AA) modeling, and coarse-grained (CG) modeling. The selected approach depends on the size of the target system (which differs among electrons, atoms, molecules, and molecular assemblies). These hierarchal approaches can be combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and/or integral equation theories for liquids, which cover all size hierarchies. Scope of review We review the framework of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, AA MD simulations, CG modeling, and integral equation theories. Applications of these methods to the dynamical ordering of biomolecular systems are also exemplified. Major conclusions The QM/MM calculation enables the study of chemical reactions. The AA MD simulation, which omits the QM calculation, can follow longer time-scale phenomena. By reducing the number of degrees of freedom and the computational cost, CG modeling can follow much longer time-scale phenomena than AA modeling. Integral equation theories for liquids elucidate the liquid structure, for example, whether the liquid follows a radial distribution function. General significance These theoretical approaches can analyze the dynamic behaviors of biomolecular systems. They also provide useful tools for exploring the dynamic ordering systems of biomolecules, such as self-assembly.

Our model is constituted by two identical tangent hard spheres surrounded by square-well attractions with same widths and progressively different depths. Gas-liquid coexistence curves are obtained by predicting pressures, free energies, and chemical potentials. In comparison with previous simulation results, RISM and OPT agree in reproducing the progressive reduction of the gas-liquid phase separation as the anisotropy of the interaction potential becomes more pronounced; in particular, the RISM theory provides reasonable predictions for all coexistence curves, bar the strong anisotropy regime, whereas OPT performs generally less well. Both theories predict a linear dependence of the critical temperature on the interaction strength, reproducing in this way the mean-field behavior observed in simulations; the critical density—that drastically drops as the anisotropy increases—turns to be less accurate. Our results appear as a robust benchmark for further theoretical studies, in support to the simulation approach, of self-assembly in model colloidal systems.},

The 3D-RISM/PC+ model can provide similar to 3 kcal/mol hydration free energy accuracy for a large variety of ionic compounds, provided that the Galvani potential of water is taken into account.

abstract = {The ionic atmosphere around nucleic acids remains only partially understood at atomic-level detail. Ion counting (IC) experiments provide a quantitative measure of the ionic atmosphere around nucleic acids and, as such, are a natural route for testing quantitative theoretical approaches. In this article, we replicate IC experiments involving duplex DNA in NaCl(aq)using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM), and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) calculations and test against recent buffer-equilibration atomic emission spectroscopy measurements. Further, we outline the statistical mechanical basis for interpreting IC experiments and clarify the use of specific concentration scales. Near physiological concentrations, MD simulation and 3D-RISM estimates are close to experimental results, but at higher concentrations ({\textgreater}0.7 M), both methods underestimate the number of condensed cations and overestimate the number of excluded anions. The effect of DNA charge on ion and water atmosphere extends 20-25 {\AA} from its surface, yielding layered density profiles. Overall, ion distributions from 3D-RISMs are relatively close to those from corresponding MD simulations, but with less Na+binding in grooves and tighter binding to phosphates. NLPB calculations, on the other hand, systematically underestimate the number of condensed cations at almost all concentrations and yield nearly structureless ion distributions that are qualitatively distinct from those generated by both MD simulation and 3D-RISM. These results suggest that MD simulation and 3D-RISM may be further developed to provide quantitative insight into the characterization of the ion atmosphere around nucleic acids and their effect on structure and stability. {\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society.},

Glucose isomerization to fructose has been investigated via cyclic and open chain mechanisms. In water, the calculations support the cyclic mechanism of glucose isomerization; with the predicted activation free energy is 23.8 kcal mol(-1) at experimental condition. Conversely, open ring mechanism is more favorable in ILs with the energy barrier is 32.4 kcal mol(-1) . Moreover, the transformation of fructose into HMF via cyclic mechanism is reasonable; the calculated activation barriers are 16.0 and 21.5 kcal mol(-1) in aqueous and ILs solutions, respectively. The solvent effects of ILs could be explained by the decomposition of free energies and radial distribution functions of solute-solvent that are produced by RISM-SCF-SEDD. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In the gas phase, MgF(3)(-) is the most stable species among the complexes (n = 1-6). In contrast, due to compensation between the intramolecular energy and solvation free energy, the stabilities of a number of complexes with different n are comparable in aqueous solution. Based on accurate evaluation of free energy change, the mole fraction of MgF(4)(2-) is the highest in the range from pF = 2.0 to 3.0 of aqueous solution. This is consistent with the available PDB data of the enzymes that catalyze the phosphoryl transfer reactions.

Specifically, we model ethanol and 1-propanol as linear rigid chains constituted by three (trimers) and four (tetramers) partially fused spheres, respectively. Thermodynamic properties of these models are examined in the RISM context, by employing closed formulae for the calculation of free energy and pressure. Gas-liquid coexistence curves for trimers and tetramers are reported and compared with already existing data for a dimer model of methanol. Critical temperatures slightly increase with the number of CH2 groups in the chain, while critical pressures and densities decrease. Such a behavior qualitatively reproduces the trend observed in experiments on methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol and suggests that our coarse-grain models, despite their simplicity, can reproduce the essential features of the phase behavior of such alcohols. The fluid structure of these models is investigated by computing radial distribution function g(ij)(r) and static structure factor S-ij(k); the latter shows the presence of a low-k peak at intermediate-high packing fractions and low temperatures, suggesting the presence of aggregates for both trimers and tetramers.

Hydrolyses of cis- and transplatins, cis- and trans-PtCl(2)(NH(3))(2), were investigated with this method. Solute geometries were optimized at the DFT level with the M06-2X functional, and free energy changes were calculated at the CCSD(T) level. In the first hydrolysis, the calculated activation free energy is 20.8 kcal/mol for cisplatin and 20.3 kcal/mol for transplatin, which agrees with the experimental and recently reported theoretical results. A Cl anion, which is formed by the first hydrolysis, somehow favorably exists in the first solvation shell as a counteranion. The second hydrolysis occurs with a similar activation free energy (20.9 kcal/mol) for cisplatin but a somewhat larger energy (23.2 kcal/mol) for transplatin to afford cis- and trans-diaqua complexes. The Cl counteranion in the first solvation shell little influences the activation free energy but somewhat decreases the endothermicity in both cis- and transplatins. The present 3D-RISM-SCF method clearly displays the microscopic solvation structure and its changes in the hydrolysis, which are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {A molecular density functional theory of solvation is presented. The solvation properties of an arbitrary solute in a given solvent, both described by a molecular force field, can be obtained by minimization of a position- and orientation-dependent free-energy density functional. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the unknown excess term of the functional can be approximated by the angular-dependent direct correlation function of the pure solvent. This function can be extracted from a preliminary MD simulation of the pure solvent by computing the angular-dependent pair distribution function and solving subsequently the molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation. The corresponding functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional cubic grid for positions and a Gauss-Legendre angular grid for orientations to provide the solvation free energy of embedded molecules at the same time as the solvent three-dimensional microscopic structure. This functional minimization procedure is much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be also pertinent to the molecular-level determination of electron-transfer properties such as reaction free energy and reorganization energy. It is illustrated for molecular solvation and photochemical electron-transfer reactions in acetonitrile, a prototypical polar aprotic solvent.},

abstract = {Inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) and classical density functional theory (DFT) each provide a framework for relating distribution functions of solutions to their thermodynamic properties. As reviewed in this work, both IST and DFT can be formulated in a way that use two "end point" simulations, one of the pure solvent and the other of the solution, to determine the solute chemical potential and other thermodynamic properties of the solution and of subvolumes in regions local to the solute containing hydrating waters. In contrast to IST, where expressions for the excess energy and entropy of solution are the object of analysis, in the DFT end point formulation of the problem, the solute-solvent potential of mean force (PMF) plays a central role. The indirect part of the PMF corresponds to the lowest order (1-body) truncation of the IST expression. Because the PMF is a free energy function, powerful numerical methods can be used to estimate it. We show that the DFT expressions for the solute excess chemical potential can be written in a form which is local, involving integrals only over regions proximate to the solute. The DFT end point route to estimating solvation free energies provides an alternative path to that of IST for analyzing solvation effects on molecular recognition and conformational changes in solution, which can lead to new insights. In order to illustrate the kind of information that is contained in the solute-solvent PMF, we have carried out simulations of $\beta$-cyclodextrin in water. This solute is a well studied "host" molecule to which "guest" molecules bind; host-guest systems serve as models for molecular recognition. We illustrate the range of values the direct and indirect parts of the solute-solvent PMF can have as a water molecule is brought to the interface of $\beta$-cyclodextrin from the bulk; we discuss the "competition" between these two terms, and the role it plays in molecular recognition.},

The photo-excitation and proton-transfer processes are computed by considering the solvent fluctuation. The calculated absorption and emission energy are in good agreement with the experiments. The changes in the dipole moment indicate that the drastic solvation relaxation is accompanied by the excitation and an ESIPT process, which is consistent with the remarkable dynamic Stokes shift observed in the experiments. We calculated the nonequilibrium free-energy contour as a function of the proton coordinate and the solvation coordinate. We conclude that although immediately after the excitation the barrier height of the ESIPT process is relatively small, the barrier becomes larger as the solvation relaxation to the excited normal state proceeds.

With a simplifying approximation in which the intermolecular bridge function is neglected, an illustrative application of the AXIS theory is made on the equilibrium oxygen and hydrogen distributions of solvent water surrounding a solute water molecule at ambient and supercritical conditions. We demonstrate through a comparison with molecular dynamics simulation results that the inclusion of the exact intramolecular correlations improves upon the 3D-RISM theory in describing the water distribution around molecular solute, in particular near the surface region of the solute molecule, though there still remain quantitative differences from the simulation results. To further improve the quantitative accuracy of the theory, one needs to incorporate the intermolecular bridge function, and a possible formulation for the approximate bridge function is suggested based on the angular decomposition.},

Using the exact long-range asymptotics of site-site direct correlation functions defined by the site-site Ornstein-Zernike equations, we regularize the ill-posed inverse problem, and then calculate site-site bridge functions and effective pair potentials for ambient water, methanol, and ethanol. We have tested the proposed algorithm and checked its performance. Our study has revealed various peculiarities of the site-site bridge functions, such as long-range behavior, strong dependence on the electrostatic interactions. Using the obtained data, we have calculated thermodynamic properties of the solvents, namely, isothermal compressibility, internal energy, and Kirkwood-Buff integrals. The obtained values are in excellent agreement not only with molecular simulations but also with available experimental data. Further extensions of the method are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The potassium channel is highly selective for K+ over other monovalent cations, and the narrow pore structure with 3 {\AA} in diameter named the selectivity filter (SF) is responsible for the selective permeation. Here we applied the statistical mechanics of liquids called three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory, and the binding configurations of the monovalent cations, Li+, Na+ and K+, with special attention on the contribution of water in the KcsA potassium channel were examined. All the three types of cations are bound in the open SF with high affinity, but with different binding coordinations: the in-cage configuration by eight carbonyl oxygens for K+, and the in-plane configuration by four carbonyl oxygens for Li+, whereas both configurations are allowed for Na+. In each case, water contributes an integral part of the ion coordination. In the case of Li+, a linear water-Li+-water complex is settled into two adjacent cages with the Li+ centered at the in-plane site. Positions of water around Na+ are more flexible, which may allow a transition between in-plane and in-cage configurations. K+ stably occupied in-cage configuration, and water occupies adjacent cages. The results provide the distinct configuration of ion and water in the SF, and serves clues for elementary process of selectivity.},

The new theoretical concept views the unfolding and refolding processes of protein as a shift of the structural distribution induced by a thermodynamic perturbation, with the variance-covariance matrix varying. Based on the theoretical concept, a method to characterize the mechanism of folding (or unfolding) is proposed. The transition state, if any, between two stable states is interpreted as a gap in the distribution, which is created due to an extensive reorganization of hydrogen bonds among back-bone atoms of protein and with water molecules in the course of conformational change. Further perspective to applying the theory to the computer-aided drug design, and to the material science, is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Statistical-mechanical, 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation is an integral equation theory of molecular liquids capable of describing, from the first principles, solvation structure and thermodynamics in complex nanoscale systems. The 3D-RISM-KH theory accurately yields the solvation structure for biomolecular systems as large as chaperonins and ion channels. It predicts 3D maps of ligand binding affinity at once without using empirical scoring functions, and has significant potential for computer-aided drug design. Recently, the 3D-RISM-KH theory was coupled with MD simulations by contracting solvent degrees of freedom to treat solvated biomolecules, and the MD/3D-RISM-KH multiscale method was implemented in the Amber molecular dynamics package [T. Luchko et al., 2010, [29]]. The MD/3D-RISM-KH method allows one to study biomolecular processes on extremely long timescales, as the statistics of rare solvent and ligand events is accounted for analytically. We further replaced the MM/GB(PB)SA post-processing which evaluates the free energy by empirical treatment of non-polar solvation effects with the MM/3D-RISM-KH method which employs 3D-RISM-KH to evaluate the solvation thermodynamics. In this paper, we briefly review the 3D-RISM-KH theory as well as the MD/3D-RISM-KH multiscale method implemented in the Amber package. We illustrate the MM/3D-RISM-KH method on binding of thiamine (vitamin of group B) to extracytoplasmic thiamine-binding lipoprotein MG289, and on the microscopic solvation properties of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) homologue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, statistical mechanics calculations in the framework of the integral equation theory using one-dimensional (1D-) and three-dimensional (3D-) reference interaction site model (RISM) approaches as well as conductivity measurements were applied. From experiment and MD simulations it was found that the mobility/diffusion coefficients of cations in the limit of infinite dilution decrease with an increasing length of the cation alkyl chain, but not linearly. The aggregation tendency of cations with long alkyl chains at higher IL concentrations impedes their diffusivity. Binding free energies of imidazolium cations with the chloride anion estimated by RISM calculations, MD simulations and experiments reveal that the association of investigated ILs as model 1,1 electrolytes in water solutions is weak but evidently dependent on the molecular structure (alkyl chain length), which also strongly affects the mobility of cations.},

The rate of the reaction is accelerated by adding LiCl to the water solvent. The structures of four transition states, endo-cis, endo-trans, exo-cis, exo-trans, were found by geometry optimization of the cyclopentadiene and methyl vinyl ketone complexes. The endo-trans structure shows the lowest energy in both water and LiCl solution. The activation barrier of the reaction in LiCl solution is lower than that in water, and the difference is in good agreement with that from experiments. The decrease in the activation barrier arises from destabilization of the reactant species. The salt effect of LiCl makes all species concerning the reaction unstable by the hydrophobic effect; however, the increased hydrophobic effect in the TS complexes is suppressed by making the hydrogen bond, which is stronger compared with the reactant methyl vinyl ketone.},

When a cellulose IIII (1 0 0) chain sheet model is optimized by DFT calculations, the sheet models spontaneously roll into tubes. The oligomers arrange in a right-handed, four-fold helix with one-quarter chain staggering, oriented with parallel polarity similar to the original crystal structure. Based on a one-quarter chain staggering relationship, six large CelNT models, consisting of 16 cellulose chains with DP = 80, are constructed by combinations of two types of chain polarities and three types of symmetry operations to generate a circular arrangement of molecular chains. All six CelNT models are examined by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations in chloroform. While four CelNT models retain a tubular form throughout MD calculations, the remaining two deform. 3D-RISM theory model is used to estimate the solvation free energies of the four CelNT models.

The common experimental techniques to measure the salvation free energies of organic molecules can be roughly separated into direct and indirect methods. The choice of one or another approach depends on the solubility and volatility of the compounds under investigation. The integral equation theory (IET) of molecular liquids has a special place among the implicit solvent methods, since it combines a reasonable level of molecular description of the solute with low computational costs. IET provides information about the solvent density around the solute which is not accessible by continuum solvent methods.

abstract = {Integral equation theory of molecular liquids based on statistical mechanics is quite promising as an essential part of multiscale methodology for chemical and biomolecular nanosystems in solution. Beginning with a molecular interaction potential force field, it uses diagrammatic analysis of the solvation free energy to derive integral equations for correlation functions between molecules in solution in the statistical-mechanical ensemble. The infinite chain of coupled integral equations for many-body correlation functions is reduced to a tractable form for 2- or 3-body correlations by applying the so-called closure relations. Solving these equations produces the solvation structure with accuracy comparable to molecular simulations that have converged but has a critical advantage of readily treating the effects and processes spanning over a large space and slow time scales, by far not feasible for explicit solvent molecular simulations. One of the versions of this formalism, the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) integral equation complemented with the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure approximation, yields the solvation structure in terms of 3D maps of correlation functions, including density distributions, of solvent interaction sites around a solute (supra)molecule with full consistent account for the effects of chemical functionalities of all species in the solution. The solvation free energy and the subsequent thermodynamics are then obtained at once as a simple integral of the 3D correlation functions by performing thermodynamic integration analytically.},

Hence we have grappled with how to utilize such approaches to understand non-intuitive results and to generate chemistry ideas that otherwise would not have been developed. Here we provide our perspective on these methods and describe how results have been interpreted and applied. We include examples from GSK and elsewhere that highlight how water methods have been (1) utilized retrospectively to explain non-intuitive structure- activity relationships and (2) applied prospectively for chemistry design.

The chemical reaction between CO(2) and MEA, which is employed in the process, consists of two steps. After the formation of the MEA-CO(2) complex ("capture"), a proton transfers from the complex to give a final product. In the present study, the overall mechanism of the reaction is discussed, especially focusing on the proton transfer step. Using RISM-SCF-SEDD, a hybrid method of electronic structure theory and statistical mechanics for molecular liquid, we clarified that the role of MEA as a base is crucial in the proton transfer step.},

The theoretical procedure is very similar to the 3D-reference interaction site model self-consistent field (RISM-SCF) approach. Since the MC-MOZ method is highly parallelized for computation, the present approach has the potential to be one of the most efficient procedures to treat chemical processes in solution. Benchmark tests to check the validity of this approach were performed for two solute (solute water and formaldehyde) systems and a simple SN2 reaction (Cl(-) + CH3Cl → ClCH3 + Cl(-)) in aqueous solution. The results for solute molecular properties and solvation structures obtained by the present approach were in reasonable agreement with those obtained by other hybrid frameworks and experiments. In particular, the results of the proposed approach are in excellent agreements with those of 3D-RISM-SCF.},

abstract = {We investigate thermodynamic and structural properties of colloidal dumbbells in the framework provided by the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory of molecular fluids and Monte Carlo simulations. We consider two different models: in the first one we set identical square-well attractions on the two tangent spheres constituting the molecule (SW-SW model); in the second scheme, one of the square-well interactions is switched off (HS-SW model). Appreciable differences emerge between the physical properties of the two models. Specifically, the k -{\textgreater} 0 behavior of SW-SW structure factors S(k) points to the presence of a gas-liquid coexistence, as confirmed by subsequent fluid phase equilibria calculations. Conversely, the HS-SW S(k) develops a low-k peak, signaling the presence of aggregates; such a process destabilizes the gas-liquid phase separation, promoting at low temperatures the formation of a cluster phase, whose structure depends on the system density. We further investigate such differences by studying the phase behavior of a series of intermediate models, obtained from the original SW-SW by progressively reducing the depth of one square-well interaction. RISM structural predictions positively reproduce the simulation data, including the rise of S(k -{\textgreater} 0) in the SW-SW model and the low-k peak in the HS-SW structure factor. As for the phase behavior, RISM agrees with Monte Carlo simulations in predicting a gas-liquid coexistence for the SW-SW model (though the critical parameters appear overestimated by the theory) and its progressive disappearance when moving toward the HS-SW model.},

The analysis upon the integrand to evaluate Uex, pv and $\mu$ex has revealed that the precise location of the first rising (FR) region in radial distribution function is the most important for the accurate evaluation of these quantities. We have applied an approximate bridge function pretending to adjust $\sigma$ parameter in the LJ potential both to HNC and KH approximations, to obtain satisfactorily corrected results regarding Uex, pv and $\mu$ex.

It is important to know the synergic role of Mg2+ and the water network surrounding Mg2+ in stabilizing the non-WC base pairs of RNA. For this purpose, free energy change of the system is calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation as Mg2+ is pulled from RNA, which causes disturbance of the water network. It was found that Mg2+ remains hexahydrated unless it is close to or far from RNA. In the pentahydrated form, Mg2+ interacts directly with RNA. Water network has been identified by two complimentary methods; MD followed by a density-based clustering algorithm and three-dimensional-reference interaction site model. These two methods gave similar results. Identification of water network around Mg2+ and non-WC base pairs gives a clue to the strong effect of water network on the stability of this RNA. Based on sequence analysis of all Eubacteria 5s rRNA, we propose that hexahydrated Mg2+ is an integral part of this RNA and geometry of base pairs surrounding it adjust to accommodate the Mg(H2O)(6)(2+). Overall the findings from this work can help in understanding the basis of the complex structure and stability of RNA with non-WC base pairs.},

Free energy component analysis of the dissociation reaction was performed to investigate the details of the contribution to the pKa shift. The magnitudes of the changes in both the electronic energy and the solvation free energy were smaller for the PCBA-complex than for PCBA.

abstract = {Traditional coupled multi-disciplinary design optimization based on computational fluid dynamics/computational structure dynamics (CFD/CSD) aims to optimize the jig shape of aircraft, and general multi-disciplinary design optimization methodol-ogy is adopted. No special consideration is given to the aircraft itself during the optimization. The main drawback of these methodologies is the huge expanse and the low efficiency. To solve this problem, we put forward to optimize the cruise shape directly based on the fact that the cruise shape can be transformed into jig shape, and a methodology named reverse iteration of structural model (RISM) is proposed to get the aero-structural performance of cruise shape. The main advantage of RISM is that the efficiency can be improved by at least four times compared with loosely-coupled aeroelastic analysis and it maintains almost the same fidelity of loosely-coupled aeroelastic analysis. An optimization framework based on RISM is proposed. The aerodynamic and structural performances can be optimized simultaneously in this framework, so it may lead to the true optimal solution. The aerodynamic performance was predicted by N-S solver in this paper. Test shows that RISM predicts the aerody-namic and structural performances very well. A wing-body configuration was optimized by the proposed optimization frame-work.

abstract = {The hepatitis delta virus ribozyme is an efficient catalyst of RNA 2 ′ -O-transphosphorylation and has emerged as a key experimental system for identifying and characterizing fundamental features of RNA catalysis. Recent structural and biochemical data have led to a proposed mechanistic model whereby an active site Mg 2+ ion facilitates deprotonation of the O2 ′ nucleophile, and a protonated cytosine residue (C75) acts as an acid to donate a proton to the O5 ′ leaving group as noted in a previous study. This model assumes that the active site Mg 2+ ion forms an inner-sphere coordination with the O2 ′ nucleophile and a nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate. These contacts, however, are not fully resolved in the crystal structure, and biochemical data are not able to unambiguously exclude other mechanistic models. In order to explore the feasibility of this model, we exhaustively mapped the free energy surfaces with different active site ion occupancies via quantum mechanical/ molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. We further incorporate a three-dimensional reference interaction site model for the solvated ion atmosphere that allows these calculations to consider not only the rate associated with the chemical steps, but also the probability of observing the system in the presumed active state with the Mg 2+ ion bound. The QM/MM results predict that a pathway involving metal-assisted nucleophile activation is feasible based on the rate-controlling transition state barrier departing from the presumed metal-bound active state. However, QM/MM results for a similar pathway in the absence of Mg 2+ are not consistent with experimental data, suggesting that a structural model in which the crystallographically determined Mg 2+ is simply replaced with Na + is likely incorrect. It should be emphasized, however, that these results hinge upon the assumption of the validity of the presumed Mg 2+ -bound starting state, which has not yet been definitively verified experimentally, nor explored in depth computationally. Thus, further experimental and theoretical study is needed such that a consensus view of the catalytic mechanism emerges.},

abstract = {One of the difficulties in application of the usual reference interaction site model self-consistent field (RISM-SCF) method to a highly polarized and bulky system arises from the approximate evaluation of electrostatic potential (ESP) with pure point charges. To improve this ESP evaluation, the ESP near a solute is directly calculated with a solute electronic wavefunction, that distant from a solute is approximately calculated with solute point charges, and they are connected with a switching function. To evaluate the fine solvation structure near the solute by incorporating the long-range solute-solvent Coulombic interaction with low computational cost, we introduced the dual solvent box protocol; one small box with the fine spacing is employed for the first and the second solvation shells and the other large box with the normal spacing is employed for long-range solute-solvent interaction. The levoglucosan formation from phenyl $\alpha$- and $\beta$-d-glucosides under basic conditions is successfully inspected by this 3D-RISM-SCF method at the MP2 and SCS-MP2 levels, though the 1D-RISM-SCF could not be applied to this reaction due to the presence of highly polarized and bulky species. This 3D-RISM-SCF calculation reproduces the experimentally reported higher reactivity of the $\beta$-anomer. The 3D-RISM-SCF-calculated activation free energy for the $\beta$-anomer is closer to the experimental value than the PCM-calculated one. Interestingly, the solvation effect increases the difference in reactivity between these two anomers. The reason is successfully elucidated with 3D-RISM-SCF-calculated microscopic solvation structure and decomposition analysis of solute-solvent interaction.},

abstract = {Solvent-induced solute polarisation of nondipolar solvents originates mainly from specific directional interactions and higher electrostatic multipole moments. Popular continuum solvation models such as the polarisable continuum models ignore such interactions and, therefore, cannot adequately model solvation effects on electronic structure in these environments. Important examples of nondipolar solvents that are indistinguishable by continuum methods are benzene and hexafluorobenzene. Both substances have very similar macroscopic properties, while solutes dissolved in either benzene or hexafluorobenzene behave differently due to their inverted electrostatic quadrupole moments and slightly different size. As a first step towards a proper and computationally feasible description of nondipolar molecular solvents, we present here integral equation theory results based on various forms of the reference interaction site model coupled to quantum-chemical calculations for benzene and hexafluorobenzene solutions of small molecules. We analyse solvation structures, also in comparison with molecular dynamics simulations, and show that predictions of transfer Gibbs energies, which define partition constants, benefit substantially from considering the exact, wave function-derived electrostatic field distribution beyond a simple point charge solute model in comparison with experimental data. Moreover, by constructing artificial uncharged and charge-inverted toy models of the solvents, it is possible to dissect the relative importance of dispersion and quadrupolar electrostatic effects on the partitioning equilibria. Such insight can help to design specifically optimised solvents to control solubility and selectivity for a wide range of applications. [GRAPHICS] .},

The calculated dynamic and structural properties of CG model show reasonable agreement with the results of the corresponding atomistic model or experiment. To evaluate the predictive power of the CG model for prediction of mass transfer and the structural properties, the relative error of diffusion coefficient RED and the residuals of radial distribution function RESRDF are introduced. Numerical results demonstrate that the CG models can quantitatively reproduce the structural and dynamic properties of the methane fluid. Furthermore, the CGMOPLS could reproduce quite well the radial distribution function, velocity autocorrelation function and diffusion coefficient.

abstract = {Humans excel in cooperative exchanges between unrelated individuals. Although this trait is fundamental to the success of our species, its evolution and mechanisms are poorly understood. Other social mammals also build long-term cooperative relationships between non-kin, and recent evidence shows that oxytocin, a hormone involved in parent-offspring bonding, is likely to facilitate non-kin as well as kin bonds. In a population of wild chimpanzees, we measured urinary oxytocin levels following a rare cooperative event--food sharing. Subjects showed higher urinary oxytocin levels after single food-sharing events compared with other types of social feeding, irrespective of previous social bond levels. Also, urinary oxytocin levels following food sharing were higher than following grooming, another cooperative behaviour. Therefore, food sharing in chimpanzees may play a key role in social bonding under the influence of oxytocin. We propose that food-sharing events co-opt neurobiological mechanisms evolved to support mother-infant bonding during lactation bouts, and may act as facilitators of bonding and cooperation between unrelated individuals via the oxytocinergic system across social mammals.},

abstract = {The ion-binding between inorganic ions and charged functional groups of glycine zwitter-ion in NaCl(aq), KCl(aq), MgCl2(aq), and CaCl 2(aq) has been investigated over a wide salt concentration range by using integral equation theory in the 3D-RISM approach. These systems mimic biological systems where binding of ions to charged residues at protein surfaces is relevant. It has been found that the stability of ion pairs formed by the carboxylate group and added inorganic cations decreases in the sequence Mg 2 + {\textgreater} Ca2 + {\textgreater} Na+ {\textgreater} K+. However, all formed ion pairs are weak and decrease in stability with increasing salt concentration. On the other hand, at a given salt concentration the stability of (- NH3+:Cl-)aq ion pairs is similar in all studied systems. The features of ion-binding and the salt concentration effect on this process are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The formalism is applied to the specific case of a finite number of Gaussian and rodlike polyelectrolytes trapped in a harmonic potential. The density profiles of the polyelectrolytes are studied over a range of lengths and numbers of polyelectrolytes in the trap, and the strength of the trap potential. For smaller polymers we recover the results for point charges. In the mean field limit the longer polymers, unlike point charges, form a shell at the boundary layer. When the interpolymer correlations are included, the density profiles of the polymers show sharp shells even at weaker trap strengths. The implications of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Experimental observations for ionic hydration free energies are highly debated mainly due to the ambiguous absolute hydration free energy of proton, $\Delta$Ghyd*(H+). Hydration free energies (HFEs) of the 112 singly charged ions in the Minnesota solvation database were predicted by six methods with explicit and implicit solvent models, namely, thermodynamic integration (TI), energy representation module (ERmod), three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM), and continuum solvation models based on the quantum mechanical charge density (SMD) and on the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) and generalized Born (GB) theories. Taking the solvent Galvani potential of water into account, the resulting real HFEs from TI calculations for the generalized Amber force field (GAFF) modeled ions best match the experiments based on $\Delta$Ghyd*(H+) = −262.4 kcal/mol (Randles Trans. Faraday Soc. 1956, 52, 1573–1581), in agreement with our previous work on charged amino acids (Zhang et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017, 8, 2705–2712). The examined computational methods show an accuracy of ∼7 kcal/mol for the GAFF-modeled ions, except for SMD with a higher accuracy of ∼4 kcal/mol. A biased deficiency in modeling anionic compounds by GAFF is observed with a larger standard deviation (SD) of 9 kcal/mol than that for cations (SD ∼ 4 kcal/mol). The relatively cheap ERmod and 3D-RISM methods reproduce TI results with good accuracy, although ERmod yields a systematic underestimation for cations by 9 kcal/mol; PB and GB generate relative (but not absolute) HFEs comparable to the TI predictions. Computational accuracy is found to be more limited by the accuracy of force fields rather than the models themselves.},

abstract = {A new statistical mechanics formulation of characterizing the structural fluctuation of protein correlated with that of water is presented based on the generalized Langevin equation and the 3D-reference interaction site model (RISM)/RISM theory of molecular liquids. The displacement vector of atom positions, and their conjugated momentum, are chosen for the dynamic variables for protein, while the density fields of atoms and their momentum fields are chosen for water. Projection of other degrees of freedom onto those dynamic variables using the standard projection operator method produces essentially two equations, which describe the time evolution of fluctuation concerning the density field of solvent and the conformation of protein around an equilibrium state, which are coupled with each other. The equation concerning the protein dynamics is formally akin to that of the coupled Langevin oscillators, and is a generalization of the latter, to atomic level. The most intriguing feature of the new equation is that it contains the variance-covariance matrix as the "Hessian" term describing the "force" restoring an equilibrium conformation, which is the second moment of the fluctuation of atom positions. The "Hessian" matrix is naturally identified as the second derivative of the free energy surface around the equilibrium. A method to evaluate the Hessian matrix based on the 3D-RISM/RISM theory is proposed. Proposed also is an application of the present formulation to the molecular recognition, in which the conformational fluctuation of protein around its native state becomes an important factor as exemplified by so called "induced fitting."},

abstract = {Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements can provide valuable information about the solvent envi- ronment around biomolecules, but it can be difficult to extract solvent-specific information from observed intensity profiles. Intensities are proportional to the square of scattering amplitudes, which are complex quantities. Amplitudes in the forward direction are real, and the contribution from a solute of known structure (and from the waters it excludes) can be estimated from theory; hence, the amplitude arising from the solvent environment can be computed by difference.We have found that this “square root subtraction scheme” can be extended to non-zero q values, out to 0.1 {\AA}−1 for the systems considered here, since the phases arising from the solute and from the water environment are nearly identical in this angle range. This allows us to extract aspects of the water and ion distributions (beyond their total numbers), by combining experimental data for the complete system with calcula- tions for the solutes.We use this approach to test molecular dynamics and integral-equation (3D-RISM (three-dimensional reference interaction site model)) models for solvent structure around myoglobin, lysozyme, and a 25 base-pair duplex DNA. Comparisons can be made both in Fourier space and in terms of the distribution of interatomic distances in real space. Generally, computed solvent distribu- tions arising from the MD simulations fit experimental data better than those from 3D-RISM, even though the total small-angle X-ray scattering patterns are very similar; this illustrates the potential power of this sort of analysis to guide the development of computational models.},

abstract = {Glycine betaine (GB) is a widespread natural osmolyte, which accumulates in the cell cytoplasm to protect structure and function of various proteins and enzymes under osmotic, salinity, or temperature stresses. It is assumed that the hydration of GB is playing an important role in the protective mechanism. However, the details of GB interactions with water surroundings are far from being fully understood. In this contribution, the hydration structure of GB under effects of concentration, temperature, and NaCl/KCl additions, as well as ion-binding of this zwitterionic compound was studied to gain information on the functioning of GB in particular and of osmolytes in general. The data were obtained by the integral equation method in the framework of the 1D- and 3D-RISM (Reference Interaction Site Model) approaches. An attempt was made to link the structural features of hydration and ion-binding of GB to its biological role. It was found that under osmolyte concentration effect, as well as under temperature and salinity stresses, GB molecules are strongly hydrated, revealing the strong ability of the osmolyte to bind a significant amount of water. These results are a confirmation for the stabilizing effect of GB on proteins under abiotic stresses via an indirect mechanism. Moreover, the salt additions stimulate the formation of direct ion-molecular associates between the charged groups of GB and inorganic ions as a result of ion-specific interactions. In our opinion, the ability of GB to retain the inorganic ions around itself is directly related to the protection of proteins from salting-out.},

Unlike conventional docking simulations, 3D-RISM-LM can incorporate the effect of water from the atomic to thermodynamic level into the binding affinity through statistical mechanics. It has been demonstrated that 3D-RISM-LM can sensitively detect even weak binding modes of small molecules over the entire surface of protein.

We show the three-dimensional distribution functions (3D-DFs) of small cations (Li + , Na + , and K + ) and the free energy profile of ions inside the open selectivity filter (SF) of the KcsA channel. Our previous results [S. Phongphanphanee, N. Yoshida, S. Oiki, F. Hirata. Abstract Book of 5th International Symposium on Molecular Science of Fluctuations toward Biological Functions, P062 (2012)] indicate that the 3D-DF for K + exhibits distinct peaks at the sites formed by the eight carbonyl oxygen atoms belonging to the surrounding peptide-backbone and residues (the cage site). Li + has sharp distributions in the 3D-DF at the center of a quadruplex composed of four carbonyl oxygen atoms (the plane site). Na + has a rather diffuse distribution throughout the SF region with peaks both in the plane and in cage sites. The results provide microscopic evidence of the phenomenological findings that Li + and Na + are not excluded from the SF region and that the binding affinity alone does not cause the ion selectivity of KcsA. In the present study, with an ion placed explicitly along the pore axis, the free energy profiles of the ions inside the SF were calculated; from these profiles we suggest a new mechanism for selective K + permeation. According to the model, a K + ion must overcome a free energy barrier that is approximately half that of Na + to exit from either of the SF mouths due to the existence of an intermediate local minimum along the route for climbing the barriers. },

abstract = {There are two physicochemical processes which are essential for living bodies to maintain their life: “self-organization” and “molecular recognition.” Protein folding and formation of cell-membrane are typical examples of the former process, in which biomolecules have to overcome the entropy barrier to organize them into some characteristic structure. On the other hand, a molecular recognition process concerns whenever a biomolecule performs its function as a “molecular-machine.” For examples, in order for the enzymatic reaction to occur, substrate molecules should be accommodated first by the protein in its reaction pockets to form so-called an enzyme-substrate (ES) complex. The two processes may not proceed spontaneously if biomolecules and ligand molecules existing by themselves in “vacuum,” because those are not in favor with respect to entropy. For instance, the protein folding is a process in which a protein folds into a native conformation, the state of least entropy, from the random coil, the state of largest entropy. Then, why do those processes occur spontaneously in our body? It is because there is always “aqueous solution” in the real environment of a living body. We have been developing a statistical mechanics theory called "3D-RISM/RISM" for past few decades, which has proven it to be capable of handling such processes stated above in biosystems. The latest development of the theory has brought the structural fluctuation of biomolecules within scope of the science, which plays a crucial role in any biological activities. The talk includes the following two topics; both are related to protein functions and drug discovery. (i) A 3D-RISM/RISM study of the oseltamivir binding efficiency with the wild-type and resistance-associated mutant forms of the viral influenza-B neraminidase.

Recently, we have developed two-dimensional-reference interaction site model to describe solvation structure near solid-liquid interface at the equilibrium state. In the present study, the theory is extended to treat dynamical aspect of the solvation; site-site Smoluchowski-Vlasov equation and surrogate Hamiltonian description are utilized to deal with the time-dependency. This combination enables us to access a long-time behavior of solvation dynamics. We apply the theory to a model system consisting of an atomistic wall and water solvent, and discuss the hydration structure dynamics near the interface at the molecular-level.},

In the present paper, we investigate the structure of these channels and provide information about the mechanism of individual molecules being encapsulated into aquaglyceroporin (GlpF) and aquaporin-1 (AQP1) channels by calculating the potential energy. In particular, we presents a mathematical model to determine the total potential energy for the interaction of the ammonia and nitric oxide molecules and different aquaporin channels which we assume to have a symmetrical cylindrical structure. We propose to describe these interactions in two steps. Firstly, we model the nitrogen atom as a discrete point and secondly, we model the three hydrogen atoms on the surface of a sphere of a certain radius. Then, we find the total potential energy by summing these interactions. Next, by considering the nitric oxide molecule as two discrete atoms uniformly distributed interacting with GlpF and AQP1 channels then gathering all pairs of interaction to determine the potential energy. Our results show that the ammonia and nitric oxide molecules can be encapsulated into both GlpF and AQP1 channels.},

In a recent paper [M. Misin, M. V. Fedorov, and D. S. Palmer, J. Chem.

This mutation, of a positively charged arginine to a neutral glutamine, does not affect the spectral tuning of photoactive yellow protein. Contradicting explanations for this phenomenon suggest either water or hydronium occupation in the cavity. To solve this controversy, we have performed 3D-RISM calculations on the mutant structure examining the solvation structure. Our results show that while there is a high probability of hydronium in the cavity compared to bulk, there is still a relatively low occupation when considering realistic concentrations. Thus our findings suggest that while the cavity is clearly accessible by hydronium, it is mostly occupied by water molecules. We expect high-resolution neutron crystallographic analysis of the mutant to confirm our prediction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We find that experimentally observed water-binding sites on the surface of bovine chymosin can be identified quickly and accurately from the density distribution functions computed by molecular integral equation theory. The bovine chymosin–bovine $\kappa$-casein complex is of industrial interest because bovine chymosin is widely used to cleave bovine $\kappa$-casein and to initiate milk clotting in the manufacturing of processed dairy products.

abstract = {Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, represents a resource for sustainable production of biofuels. Thermochemical treatments make lignocellulosic biomaterials more amenable to depolymerization by exposing cellulose microfibrils to enzymatic or chemical attacks. In such treatments, the solvent plays fundamental roles in biomass modification, but the molecular events underlying these changes are still poorly understood. Here, the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation has been employed to analyze the role of water in cellulose aggregation under different thermodynamic conditions. The results show that, under ambient conditions, highly structured hydration shells around cellulose create repulsive forces that protect cellulose microfibrils from aggregating. Under hydrothermal pretreatment conditions, however, the hydration shells lose structure and cellulose aggregation is favoured. These effects are largely due to a decrease in cellulose-water interactions relative to those at ambient conditions, so that cellulose-cellulose attractive interactions become prevalent. Our results provide an explanation to the observed increase in the lateral size of cellulose crystallites when biomass is subject to pretreatments, and deepen the current understanding of the mechanisms of biomass modification.},

abstract = {In the present research, a comprehensive mixed-mode I/II criterion for fracture investigation of orthotropic materials with arbitrary crack-fibre angle is proposed. The strain energy release rate concept is extended for orthotropic materials based on a Reinforced Isotropic Solid Model (RISM). RISM assumes that the crack growth occurs in isotropic matrix of a composite material. Fibres are defined as reinforcement of the matrix and have appeared in analytical relations as stress reduction coefficients. Since in arbitrary crack–fibre angle case, fracture toughness of the orthotropic material is not measurable, a new material property called ‘Equivalent Fracture Toughness' (EFT) is introduced. The ETF is defined in such a manner that it is easy to measure and is not dependent on fracture properties of composite material such as mode II fracture toughness (KIIc) which needs large number of tests. The accuracy of the proposed criterion as well as the coincidence with the nature of fracture of orthotropic materials will be approved by comparing the extracted fracture limit curves for various crack-fibre angles with available experimental data.},

We perform sampling using molecular dynamics (MD) of the structural relaxation of neutral pristine and negatively charged sulfated CNC of various lengths in explicit water solvent and then employ the statistical mechanical 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation to evaluate the solvation structure and thermodynamics of the relaxed CNC in ambient aqueous NaCl solution at a concentration of 0.0-0.25 mol/kg. The MD sampling induces a right-hand twist in CNC and rearranges its initially ordered structure with a macrodipole of high-density charges at the opposite faces into small local spots of alternating charge at each face. This surface charge rearrangement observed for both neutral and charged CNC significantly affects the distribution of ions around CNC in aqueous electrolyte solution. The solvation free energy (SFE) of charged sulfated CNC has a minimum at a particular electrolyte concentration depending on the surface charge density, whereas the SFE of neutral CNC increases linearly with NaCl concentration. The SFE contribution from Na(+) counterions exhibits behavior similar to the NaCl concentration dependence of the whole SFE. An analysis of the 3D maps of Na(+) density distributions shows that these model CNC particles exhibit the behavior of charged nanocolloids in aqueous electrolyte solution: an increase in electrolyte concentration shrinks the electric interfacial layer and weakens the effective repulsion between charged CNC particles. The 3D-RISM-KH method readily treats solvent and electrolyte of a given nature and concentration to predict effective interactions between CNC particles in electrolyte solution. We provide CNC structural models and a modeling procedure for studies of effective interactions and the formation of ordered phases of CNC suspensions in electrolyte solution.},

abstract = {We propose the thermodynamic integration along a spatial reaction coordinate using the molecular dynamics simulation combined with the three-dimensional reference interaction site model theory. This method provides a free energy calculation in solution along the reaction coordinate defined by the Cartesian coordinates of the solute atoms. The proposed method is based on the blue moon algorithm which can, in principle, handle any reaction coordinate as far as it is defined by the solute atom positions. In this article, we apply the present method to the complex formation process of the crown ether 18-Crown-6 (18C6) with the potassium ion in an aqueous solution. The separation between the geometric centers of these two molecules is taken to be the reaction coordinate for this system. The potential of mean force (PMF) becomes the maximum at the separation between the molecular centers being ∼4 Å, which can be identified as the free energy barrier in the process of the molecular recognition. In a separation further than the free energy barrier, the PMF is slightly reduced to exhibit a plateau. In the region closer than the free energy barrier, approach of the potassium ion to the center of 18C6 also decreases the PMF. When the potassium ion is accommodated at the center of 18C6, the free energy is lower by -5.7 ± 0.7 kcal/mol than that at the above mentioned plateau or converged state. By comparing the results with those from the free energy calculation along the coupling parameters obtained in our previous paper [T. Miyata, Y. Ikuta, and F. Hirata, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 044114 (2010)], it is found that the effective interaction in water between 18C6 and the potassium ion vanishes beyond the molecular-center-separation of 10 Å. Furthermore, the conformation of 18C6 is found to be significantly changed depending upon the 18C6-K(+) distance. A proper conformational sampling and an accurate solvent treatment are crucial for realizing the accurate PMF, and we believe that the proposed method is useful to evaluate the PMF in a solution. A discussion upon the PMF in terms of the three-dimensional distribution function for the solvent is also presented.},

Here we report a benchmark study of n-octanol solvation free energy calculations using this theory. The choice of correct force field parameters is quintessential for the success of 3D-RISM theory, and we present a guideline to obtain them for n-octanol solvent. Our best prediction of the solvation free energy on a set of 205 small organic molecules supplemented with the so-called "universal correction" scheme yields relative mean unsigned error of 0.94 kcal/mol against the reported database. The best agreement is obtained with the united atom (UA) type force field parametrization of n-octanol with the van der Waals parameters of hydroxyl hydrogen reported by Kobryn et al.},

abstract = {The changes in the partial molar volume (PMV) associated with the conformational transition of an alanine-rich peptide AK16 from the alpha-helix structure to various random coil structures are calculated by the three-dimensional interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory coupled with the Kirkwood-Buff theory. The volume change is analyzed by decomposing it into contributions from geometry and hydration: the changes in the van der Waals, void, thermal, and interaction volume. The total change in the PMV is positive. This is primarily due to the growth of void space within the peptide, which is canceled in part by the volume reduction resulting from the increase in the electrostatic interaction between the peptide and water molecules. The changes in the void and thermal volume of the coil structures are widely distributed and tend to compensate each other. Additionally, the relations between the hydration volume components and the surface properties are investigated. We categorize coil structures into extended coils with the PMV smaller than helix and general coils with the PMV larger than helix. The pressure therefore can both stabilize and destabilize the coil structures. The latter seems to be a more proper model of random coil structures of the peptide.},

abstract = {We report a method to dramatically improve the accuracy of hydration free energies (HFE) calculated by the 1D and 3D reference interaction site models (RISM) of molecular integral equation theory. It is shown that the errors in HFEs calculated by RISM approaches using the Gaussian fluctuations (GF) free energy functional are not random, but can be decomposed into linear combination of contributions from different structural elements of molecules (number of double bonds, number of OH groups, etc.). Therefore, by combining RISM/GF with cheminformatics, one can develop an accurate method for HFE prediction. We call this approach the structural description correction model (SDC) ( Ratkova et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2010 , 114 , 12068 ). In this work, we investigated the prediction quality of the SDC model combined with 1D and 3D RISM approaches. In parallel, we analyzed the computational performance of these two methods. The SDC model parameters were obtained by fitting against a training set of 53 simple organic molecules. To demonstrate that the values of these parameters were transferable between different classes of molecules, the models were tested against 98 more complex molecules (including 38 polyfragment compounds). The results show that the 3D RISM/SDC model predicts the HFEs with very good accuracy (RMSE of 0.47 kcal/mol), while the 1D RISM approach provides only moderate accuracy (RMSE of 1.96 kcal/mol). However, a single 1D RISM/SDC calculation takes only a few seconds on a PC, whereas a single 3D RISM/SDC HFE calculation is approximately 100 times more computationally expensive. Therefore, we suggest that one should use the 1D RISM/SDC model for large-scale high-throughput screening of molecular hydration properties, while further refinement of these properties for selected compounds should be carried out with the more computationally expensive but more accurate 3D RISM/SDC model.},

abstract = {An integral equation theory which is applicable to inhomogeneous molecular liquids is proposed. The "inhomogeneous reference interaction site model (RISM)" equation derived here is a natural extension of the RISM equation to inhomogeneous systems. This theory makes it possible to calculate the pair correlation function between two molecules which are located at different density regions. We also propose approximations concerning the closure relation and the intramolecular susceptibility of inhomogeneous molecular liquids. As a preliminary application of the theory, the hydration structure around an ion is investigated. Lithium, sodium, and potassium cations are chosen as the solute. Using the Percus trick, the local density of solvent around an ion is expressed in terms of the solute-solvent pair correlation function calculated from the RISM theory. We then analyze the hydration structure around an ion through the triplet correlation function which is defined with the inhomogeneous pair correlation function and the local density of the solvent. The results of the triplet correlation functions for cations indicate that the thermal fluctuation of the hydration shell is closely related to the size of the solute ion. The triplet correlation function from the present theory is also compared with that from the Kirkwood superposition approximation, which substitutes the inhomogeneous pair correlation by the homogeneous one. For the lithium ion, the behavior of the triplet correlation functions from the present theory shows marked differences from the one calculated within the Kirkwood approximation.},

The local minima in the potential of mean force occur at distances allowing well defined layers of solvent between the plates but are not coincident with those found in simulation of the same potential regardless of the theoretical methods tested here.

abstract = {The octanol-water partition coefficient is an important physical-chemical characteristic widely used to describe hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of chemical compounds. The partition coefficient is related to the transfer free energy of a compound from water to octanol. Here, we introduce a new protocol for prediction of the partition coefficient based on the statistical-mechanical, 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation. It was shown recently that with the compound-solvent correlation functions obtained from the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation, the free energy functional supplemented with the correction linearly related to the partial molar volume obtained from the Kirkwood-Buff/3D-RISM theory, also called the "universal correction" (UC), provides accurate prediction of the hydration free energy of small compounds, compared to explicit solvent molecular dynamics [ Palmer , D. S. ; J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 2010 , 22 , 492101 ]. Here we report that with the UC reparametrized accordingly this theory also provides an excellent agreement with the experimental data for the solvation free energy in nonpolar solvent (1-octanol) and so accurately predicts the octanol-water partition coefficient. The performance of the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) and Gaussian fluctuation (GF) functionals of the solvation free energy, with and without UC, is tested on a large library of small compounds with diverse functional groups. The best agreement with the experimental data for octanol-water partition coefficients is obtained with the KH-UC solvation free energy functional.},

abstract = {We predict cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients (log D 7.4) for drug-like molecules taken from the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge by the "embedded cluster reference interaction site model" (EC-RISM) integral equation theory. This task involves the coupled problem of predicting both partition coefficients (log P) of neutral species between the solvents and aqueous acidity constants (pK a) in order to account for a change of protonation states. The first issue is addressed by calibrating an EC-RISM-based model for solvation free energies derived from the "Minnesota Solvation Database" (MNSOL) for both water and cyclohexane utilizing a correction based on the partial molar volume, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.4 kcal mol(-1) for water and 0.8-0.9 kcal mol(-1) for cyclohexane depending on the parametrization. The second one is treated by employing on one hand an empirical pK a model (MoKa) and, on the other hand, an EC-RISM-derived regression of published acidity constants (RMSE of 1.5 for a single model covering acids and bases). In total, at most 8 adjustable parameters are necessary (2-3 for each solvent and two for the pK a) for training solvation and acidity models. Applying the final models to the log D 7.4 dataset corresponds to evaluating an independent test set comprising other, composite observables, yielding, for different cyclohexane parametrizations, 2.0-2.1 for the RMSE with the first and 2.2-2.8 with the combined first and second SAMPL5 data set batches. Notably, a pure log P model (assuming neutral species only) performs statistically similarly for these particular compounds. The nature of the approximations and possible perspectives for future developments are discussed.},

abstract = {Water is an important component in living systems and deserves better understanding in chemistry and biology. However, due to the difficulty of investigating the water functions in protein structures, it is usually ignored in computational modeling, especially in the field of computer-aided drug design. Here, using the potential of mean forces (PMFs) approach, we constructed a water PMF (wPMF) based on 3946 non-redundant high resolution crystal structures. The extracted wPMF potential was first used to investigate the structure pattern of water and analyze the residue hydrophilicity. Then, the relationship between wPMF score and the B factor value of crystal waters was studied. It was found that wPMF agrees well with some previously reported experimental observations. In addition, the wPMF score was also tested in parallel with 3D-RISM to measure the ability of retrieving experimentally observed waters, and showed comparable performance but with much less computational cost. In the end, we proposed a grid-based clustering scheme together with a distance weighted wPMF score to further extend wPMF to predict the potential hydration sites of protein structure. From the test, this approach can predict the hydration site at the accuracy about 80{\%} when the calculated score lower than -4.0. It also allows the assessment of whether or not a given water molecule should be targeted for displacement in ligand design. Overall, the wPMF presented here provides an optional solution to many water related computational modeling problems, some of which can be highly valuable as part of a rational drug design strategy.},

The energy function is the sum of the conformational energy and the solvation free energy. The solvation free energy for a fixed conformation of the peptide molecule is calculated using the RISM theory. The replica-exchange method is modified so that the dependence of the energy function on the temperature can be incorporated. The effectiveness of the combined approach is demonstrated for Met-enkephalin in water. It is argued that the number of replicas required for a peptide molecule immersed in water is drastically reduced by employing the combined approach. Solvation properties and free energy surfaces of Met-enkephalin in water are discussed.},

abstract = {We reveal how water solvent determines the self-assembly pathway and stability of organic rosette nanotubes (RNTs) and show their possible functions, using three-dimensional molecular theory of solvation (a.k.a. 3D-RISM). Structural water molecules penetrate the pockets on the RNT outer surface, form a wetting monolayer in the RNT channel and bridge RNT rosettes. We predict that the inner water shell might stabilize rare gas atoms inside the RNT channel, and envision molecular devices with RNT channels transporting water or holding guest molecules for targeted delivery.},

@article{Mrugalla_Stefa_JPM_2016,
abstract = {Complex formation between molecules in solution is the key process by which molecular interactions
are translated into functional systems. These processes are governed by the binding or free energy
of association which depends on both direct molecular interactions and the solvation contribution. A
design goal frequently addressed in pharmaceutical sciences is the optimization of chemical
properties of the complex partners in the sense of minimizing their binding free energy with respect
to a change in chemical structure. Here, we demonstrate that liquid-state theory in the form of the
solute–solute equation of the reference interaction site model provides all necessary information
for such a task with high efficiency. In particular, computing derivatives of the potential of mean
force (PMF), which defines the free-energy surface of complex formation, with respect to potential
parameters can be viewed as a means to define a direction in chemical space toward better binders.
We illustrate the methodology in the benchmark case of alkali ion binding to the crown ether
18-crown-6 in aqueous solution. In order to examine the validity of the underlying solute–solute
theory, we first compare PMFs computed by different approaches, including explicit free-energy
molecular dynamics simulations as a reference. Predictions of an optimally binding ion radius based
on free-energy derivatives are then shown to yield consistent results for different ion parameter
sets and to compare well with earlier, orders-of-magnitude more costly explicit simulation results.
This proof-of-principle study, therefore, demonstrates the potential of liquid-state theory for
molecular design problems.},

abstract = {We proposed linear response approximation to reference interaction site model self-consistent field explicitly including spatial electron density distribution (RISM-SCF-SEDD). Because the electrostatic potential induced by solvent molecules is approximated by linear response to the density change of solute molecule, new algorithm becomes significantly simple compared to the original RISM-SCF-SEDD. The present method was applied to simple molecules and p-nitroaniline (PNA). The maximum relative error of the linear response approximation is less than 1.0{\%} in the solvation free energies of the simple molecules. The present method also achieved a stable calculation of PNA.},
